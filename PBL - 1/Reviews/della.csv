The queue for sky cycle is very long and there is no seating arrangement as we have to wait .
The property is comparable to international resorts and we were completely blown away by the attention to detail in many aspects of the resorts stay.
The problem could have been solved at the time of check out itself instead of doing this all unnecessary time loss for us so anyways please keep up your star category of service and hospitality with a good treatment at the end by solving and paying some respect for the customer who is coming for such a wonderful experience not to end in a bad note we will come for sure next time and we will also not trust our TA who betrayed us this time
