MARINE DRIVE
We hired a car to take us around to see the sights. What lovely places youâ€™ll see. Some areas are cleaner than others. Amazing homes.
"Glorious daily walks up and down the Marine Drivr to stay fit after several dinners in South Mumbai. In the same time you join the Mumbai people relaxing, doing fitness, eating, drinking etc. A vivid experience"
It’s always a pleasure to walk along Marine Drive in Mumbai. The Locals and Tourist are found walking and jogging along Marine Drive. The Queens Necklace is a great view but with the pollution can be bothersome at times. It’s advisable to stroll along Marine Drive when one visits Mumbai.
"I was there during the day, and was not too crowed. Clean place. Relaxing. I didn’t see the lights at night but I bet it’s beautiful"
The Marine Drive is a fantastic place to roam around with fresh atmosphere and a beautiful environment.
"This is the most beautiful place in Mumbai. It is crowded every day of the week. It is visited by almost all the visitors to Mumbai. There won't be a person who did not visit Marine Drive who has come to Mumbai for any work. This place appears to be like Diamond Necklace at night. You experience the vagaries of nature in Monsoon here. In monsoon, we get a spectacular view of Ganapati Visarjan throughout the day and night on Ananat Chaturdashi day. Married as well as new unmarried couples visit this place and enjoy the beautiful sea here. Friends and groups of people flock to this place every day as well as night."
"I absolutely loved this place! I love to have a glimpse of water! Just went by here and manage to experience it for a few minutes! But I´m definitely coming back here with my spouse to spend time here! Got to see many young couples here, catching a breeze... Really place place!"
"Such a beautiful place it is! You will surely have a great time here with your loved ones , not only loved ones but also alone , its so beautifully structured!! its our fav place to spend the evenings!!"
"Nice quiet walk and we were relatively left alone, I was expecting people would try and sell us things but it didn’t happen once. Very busy but worth a walk down while you’re here. Took about half an hour start to finish."
Stayed at the Oberoi Mumbai. Loved the view from our suite Loved the vibe of the area. Our driver enlightened us as to the beauty and use of the area around the drive
"Walk along the sea front is a nice way to spend a weekend morning. Evenings brings everyone out to enjoy the seaside. Good place to just walk and enjoy. Spend a few moments or all day here, it's up to you."
"If you are in Mumbai with your friends and feel like chilling, there is no better place than Marine Drive. Marine Drive is a great place in Mumbai. You will not forget the beautiful moments spent here."
My family loves visiting this place during rainy season. It has the best view during rains. The place is so crowded on 31st of December. Must visit during winters in the morning. So cold and chilling.
It's always Serene to sit or have a walk by the tracks to enjoy fresh breeze and the calmness of Arabian Sea.
Another must visit place... The shape is like a necklace... u may visit this place day and/or night as both are just giving a one beautiful necklace’s curve of bay view of Mumbai’s skyline. One best observation location is the the Trident hotel...
"If in Mumbai, this is a place to visit in the evening as the sun sets. As darkness steps n lights switched on, one can hava a view of the Queens Neckless, its a beautiful view so natural n georgous."
"A MUST visit location in Mumbai. I went there, early AM (8:00) and again, after 7:00 PM. The place was bustling at night. A good vibe and great views. In the AM, there were less numbers of people, but many were exercising and walking to keep fit."
Good to have a 4 km walk from one end to other. Shaped as necklace looks great at night with the lights on. Cool sea breeze and ofcourse Girgaum Chowpatty to enjoy the beach and Mumbai Street food.
The place is good for walking but season matters a lot.it is neat clean but very busy in evening.You need to be very familiar to croud and careful about young kids as if you sit on the wall it is dangerous for kids
"Beautiful 3 kms stretch.. with a fantastic view of the Worli, Malabar hill, Nariman point skyline on one side and gushing water on the other. Be it morning, day time or night.. the entire stretch is very lively.. Also important to state that the administration and the visitors both are doing their bit to keep the drive clean."
Marine drive always brings me back history of the 60’s it was a time where it was the it place it’s good to go back and re connect that nice time you had
This is a lovely pedestrianised path to walk along the coast. It provides great views of Mumbai sky scrapers as well as the sunset. There are points marked in the concrete to show the distances. This area is known as the Queen's Necklace as when viewed from an elevated point it resembles pearls in a necklace.
I think this place is over hyped in the tourist itinerary. Nothing to do.Lots of couples sitting there.
"Marine Drive is a coastal road, which was constructed after land reclaimed by the Back Bay Reclaimation Company. It was built with the excavated earth of the Ballard Estate in Bombay. A Tourist Attraction offering the view of the Arabian Sea! People come here for Morning Walk/Jog/Run, it’s even more fun to cycle. •Nearest Railway Station - Marine Lines • Uber Stop - Marine Drive • Nearest Hotel - Trident, Marine Drive •Stadium - Wankhede Stadium"
It's awesome to spend time near the Arabian Sea. Being with friends during late evening is really worth spending time!!
"This place is really nice, clean and peaceful. You can go alone to enjoy the cold fresh air, with your partner if you want to be in a romantic place or with your friends for having good quality fun. Amazing place."
Houses are very nice at the end very expensive like London type at the end. ????????????????????????????
the serenity is absolute and everyone would love to visit it. Specially at night time the crowd is amazing. Quite and love the wave sounds
loved it beautiful drive except if you get caught in the traffic ..very clean ..January is not the month to have a clear view of the Queens necklace as there was an over cast
Beautiful drives with lots of shopping and food outlets Very neat and tidy areas People are so friendly however the downside are the sales people that force you to enter shops as they obtain a commission
"Marine drive , famous place and also crowded with tourist and local peoples, great atmosphere for enjoying few hours"
"Known as the ""Queen's necklace"" as its semi-circular shape looks like a beautiful piece of jewelry at night when it is lit up. Stunning sight"
We went for a walk along the drive. Not much to see in the harbour and we couldn't see the buildings across the harbour due to the smog.! Wouldn't recommend this.
"Lovely sunset, very clean and great views over the Arabian Sea. Fantastic. Peace full in a very busy city. Worth a visit and walk on the promenade."
Any we can visit the Marine drive but morning and evening are best time to visit Marine Drive. We will experience fresh sea with sun rise between 5 am - 8 am.
"This is a nice place, spend some time int he evening, cool breeze, wherein you can see some high rise buildings, awesome lighting in the night."
"Nothing special. Its nice to walk by the sea but dont expect something more than that. There's no shops, resteurants and etc."
"When the locals are cooling off by the water. All lite up, it sparkles. We saw two wedding celebrations in what looked like baseball fields decorated to the hilt with neon projections of the festivities."
"Whether you want to jog or walk or chill with friends or just sip fresh coconut water and some hot peanuts, Marine drive is a place where you can spend your time, to be on your own or with your friends. Beautiful and at its best to watch the sunset, marine drive promenade is a spot in Mumbai which no other city in India has."
"We visited this walking path in the early afternoon. This was a mistake as there is no shade to be had. Also the pollution clogging the sky at this time makes the city look quite ugly. I can only imagine that it is a much nicer place in the evening or night. Seeing how different the ""cuddling culture"" is around the water was very interesting for us to observe. The nearby beach is also nice and clean, just don't go swimming there. The water is toxic."
"Been to Marine Drive so many times, but I still fi8nd the place to be special. I was there today, so I thought I'd write this review. Day or night, whether you're walking or jogging down the broad sidewalk or driving, the Arabian Sea sparkling along Mumbai's shore is such a soothing sight. In the monsoon, when the waves crash, it's an awesome sight. These days, visitors sometimes stay in the suburbs and don't get around to checking out Marine Drive. I would say, don't miss it. If you haven't been down Marine Drive, you haven't really seen Mumbai"
"Bombay (Mumbai) will not be the same without the Marine Drive. Over the last few decades it has seen a number of changes but the charm remains unchanged. It can do with a few more trees and plants but otherwise I feel that they have maintained the drive very well. You can go at any time of the day and the place is buzzing. Different parts of the day add a different flavour to the place. The crowd is always mixed ranging from young ones to the elderly and the poor to the elite. Mornings you see a lot of health conscious people on their daily jogs or walks. Then you have the youngsters bunking college or just out on a day date sitting sipping on soft drinks, and looking out at the sea and chatting. Evenings one can spot people returning from office taking a break and a lot of working couples can be seen sipping on tea/coffee and just chatting (maybe discussing their budget, days experience at office and planning the next day). As the night dawns youngsters start filling in the place and after dark one can see a lot of couples just sitting and making out. The ones who are more adventurous jump down to the rocks and hide ;) Post mid-night you want to relax near the sea then this is the place. The best part is that you will always find something to munch on and sip along. Good tea and coffee is also available and what better way to have it than by the sea. There are also some masseurs and one can get a decent massage. But be careful as some of them can be very pesky. In February I and a few friends got foot massages and ended up going for the hand, back and head too. Make sure you check and fix the price in advance else might pay a little extra but then again, there is no price tag to fun and relaxation near the sea. So go there to have a good time and take in the sea breeze :) There are some great places where you can book yourself into if you are looking for places to stay near the Marine Drive. if you are coming from the suburbs do check on the return trains else you can always call for a cab. There are many options from the regular black cabs to the branded radio cabs. Take your pick. Be careful when crossing the road especially during the nights as some people drive rash and are not at all considerate."
Marine drive is te best place to visit when u simply want to relax. Take a stroll or just sit and relax by the sea side watching the waves and hearing their sound. The best time to vist marine drive would be the monsoons. There are a lot of good eateries around in case u feel hungry.
"In the old Bollywood movies, whenever the hero came to Bombay (as it then was) to seek his fortune, a shot of Marine Drive was almost de rigueur to establish that he has reached the big bad city. This is how iconic the Marine Drive is as a Mumbai landmark. Its also called ""Queens necklace"" for the touristy types but unlike most tourist baits, this name really does do it justice -- just see it in its entire 4+ km expanse at night and you will understand why the name. Btw, the official name for Marine Drive is ""Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road""; named after a great son of India. However, nobody ever uses it and be prepared for blank looks if you ask people for directions to ""Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road"". Try Marine Drive instead and watch their faces light up with comprehension. A tip --avoid Chowpatty beach. Dirty, crowded and just too touristy. Instead sit on the sea-side parapet @ Marine Drive, enjoy the sea-side breeze and watch India's maximum city go about its business. Definitely worth a visit, or two, or even more..."
If you one is visiting Mumbai its mandatory for him/her to experience Marine drive especially in the night and feel the zip and energy that Mumbai is famous for ! So next time when someone visits Mumbai..zip through marine drive for sure ! Dr.Prashanth Kulkarni
"Marine Drive is smth special - its heart of Mumbai, all people feel desire to walk there, to sit and enjoy sunset or sunrise, its amazing place to click pictures, to sit and chat with friends, to walk alone full of your thoughts. All will find their own Marine Drive."
"Marine Drive has a Special place in my heart as i studied in a college just on Marine Drive. We Mumbaikar's are blessed as we have such a lovely place to go to at nights. Especially during the summer nights, Both the view & the whether there is amazing. Marine drive is a must go for all."
"Just find the right time (sans mumbai traffic to go to Marine drive and it's a wonderful place!! Recommended to go there late in the night. Take a stroll, sit down, relax and have wonderful kulfi from nearby famous kulfiwala!!"
The drive was amazing. The queens necklace is a must see for all. Do not miss the amazing Parsi sweets from Parsi dairy farm - esp Sutterfeni !
"A nice place to visit. you can find all sorts of people and street food there.You can find people jogging around,some are doing exercises and some couples also roaming around.You can also find celebreties jogging around.You can feel cool breeze.You can enjoy sunset.If you are alone you can go there and who knows you get"
"Must say, I fell in love with this place as soon as I landed there. Cool breeze, small droplets of water in the air, so many couples, snacks all around. A perfect settings to be with your sweetheart in the evening, just that my sweetheart was at home :(."
"hang out with the locals for an evening stroll on the marine drive ! If you're lucky, you'll be staying at the great trident hotel and can go up to your room afterwards for the grand view ;-)"
This is such an amazing display of Mumbai spirit... I love this place and just dont get tired being here...
Fantastic place to spend time with your loved ones while taking a slow walk along the Queen's necklace. Looks immensely beautiful especially in the evening and night.
The Marine Drive or better known as Queen's Necklace is an excellent walk when you are with your better half. There is nothing romantic than walking together holding hands on marine drive. The romance multiplies at the time during high tide. The place can be reached by local train or local bus. One should not miss when in Mumbai
Awesome view of Mumbai. Sit on the shore and see the beautiful sea humming and the city with lights glowing. It is place where one can go in the evening to relax after hard day's work.
Its a totaly TP place with sea view and benches to sit for free. far from most of places in other than south mumbai..
Oh! what a look of this beautiful place in night. It looks like queen's garland. Ocean view and Land view both are superb. Never miss a drive on Marine drive it is pleasant and will relax you after work in Mumbai. Do carry with you some extra time for Marine drive.
Marine Drive is one of the most beautiful place in Mumbai. I've been there with some friends after midnight and it was really nice to chill out and have a hot beverage. The view was awesome. Love the atmosphere...
"Ever have one of those days where you need to walk for miles and stare at something beautiful? Marine Drive is the perfect place for one of those days. I walked Marine Drive for 5 miles and still never reached the end. You can either walk on top of the seawall and star onto the concrete ""jacks"" or you can walk street-level and just see the ocean meet the horizon. Definitely worth an hour stroll, you won't regret it. Enjoy!"
nice place to spend an evening with friends n family.. rainy season is a must go to watch the high tide but beware of the heavy rains.
"This is one of the prettiest places in Mumbai. Nicknamed ""The Queen's Necklace"" due to its shape, it is one of the most visited places in Mumbai. No trip to Mumbai without a visit to the Marine Drive is complete. Nothing more than a promenade, yet, it is the ambience of this place which makes it so special. Always filled with couples enjoying a romantic moment this place is one of the few places in Mumbai to enjoy sunsets. This place is simply heaven in the monsoon and simply blow you away."
"Marine Drive is a 4.3-kilometre-long boulevard in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast, which is a natural bay. The road links Nariman Point to Babulnath and Malabar Hill. Marine Drive is situated over reclaimed land facing west-south-west. The bay is part of the Arabian Sea. In 2012, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai announced that the entire road would be resurfaced, 72 years after it was originally laid"
"Well, you will be surprised at what Mumbai can offer you. And this place is a classic example. Located in the poshest areas of Mumbai, you can enjoy the wonderful sea breeze either by spending few bucks on eating street side food or splurge on expensive restaurants. Take a stroll along the beach and relax at the promenade. You will see couples kissing, families spending a weekend out, friends chatting and fitness freaks jogging. Do not forget to eat the home made Rustomjee ice creams. It is a small shop which is tucked away just opposite to the Ambassador hotel. They have been making home made ice creams for decades and the choices are mind blowing. For maximum enjoyment, buy a ice cream sandwich and eat away to glory. One of my favorite evening spots in Mumbai."
"U go anytime after 5:30-6pm to marine drive ,it drives u crazy. The only place where i could sit alone(really mean it) for hours ... Saturday Night = Must Visit"
"Marine drive was around 10 minutes away from our hotel near CST station when I visited Mumbai in January, 2013. We spent the whole day at Elephanta Caves, returned at noon, took rest at hotel and planned to set off for Marine Drive in evening. We took a taxi drive to the place, tasted delicious Pav Bhajis and spend around 4 hours there by the sea. We didn't realize when the time spent by. It was a fantastic place to visit, one can spend some quality time here. The scenic view is good. the best part I liked is night para-sailing. There is an organisation near to Marine Drive which operates para-sailing at night. We spend some quality time there and got back to our hotel at mid night."
Took a nice walk and enjoyed taking pictures. Couldn't sit there as it was very dirty. Enjoyed walking in the cool breeze and hot sun.
From the morning even in the hotsun you will see lovers hugging and kisses all over the place.. its quite a scenic place
This was post Durga Puja yet there were trucks lined up for immersion. The Marine Lines walkway... with the queen's necklace was clean and well-lit. There were many people and place seemed safe. There were many cabs and autos easily accessible before Chowpatti. It was very relaxing and fun thing to do... Only wish they had clean bathrooms - may be a high end paid service if possible. :)
a diamond necklace in the neck of queen mumbai !! worth visit with kids in late night !! rem to keep some snacks and water bottle!! as at times it get vanished due to heavy demand!!
"My one of the most popular place in Mumbai. Great place for walking- I always cherish the memories of walking through Marine Drive in a breath of fresh air and view of setting sun. One of the most happening places with crowd up to late night. The night view of Marine Drive- ‘Queen’s Necklace - is stupendous. At one end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach, a popular beach. Many restaurants / local fast foods are also available in the stretch of the road. An ideal place for relaxation at the end of a tiring day."
My office was close and all my friends use to hangout there everyday after work. Hearing the sound of waves make you forget all your worries and you'll feel peaceful. A must go place in Mumbai downtown.
"A must visit place to visit if you are in Mumbai. Queens necklace view at night is a sight to savour, recently renovated and maintained really well, give you the real felling os what Mumbai was and should be. With cowpatty & tarapore fish aquarium near by plus some water sports around the corner, this should be your ideal getaway for few hours"
"Marine Dive in Mumbai is muti km stretch on Arabian Sea shore right upto Nariman Point. In the morning, it is totally peaceful and healthy for morning walk. In daytime it is full of city rush and traffic. In the evening, it is amazing and marvelous one to watch sun set. In the night, it is all along a chain of beautiful lights. It is also nick named as ""Queen's Necklace”. None of the visitors to Mumbai forgets to visit Marine Drive."
"This south Mumbai beach front , a three and half kilometre stretch in a semi circular shape, is a favourite family place for leisure and get togethers . At night, the streetlights, in the median of the long drive of semi circular road, shine beautifully, giving the place the name of ""Queen's Necklace. The place is barely a kilometre away from Churchgate railway station, the Western railway terminal. Taxis and local buses are also easily available. The southern end of the drive is called as lands end point and the northern one is the famous Choupatty, the Mumbai beach. Beautifully decked horse carriages are also available to cover the strech, which is a tourist attraction. Other important tourist places you can cover from here are the Taraporewala emporium, The National Centre for Performing Arts, and the Babulnath temple. The place gets very crowded with strollers, evening walkers, tourists on weekends and holidays."
"Marine Drive (Marathi: ???? ??????) is a 3-kilometre-long boulevard in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast, which is a natural bay. The road links Nariman Point to Babulnath and Malabar Hill. Marine Drive is situated over reclaimed land facing west-south-west. The bay is part of the Arabian Sea. Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because if viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls,forming a necklace. It is also the world's largest viewing gallery and hence has been a host to a number of events that take place along the promenade."
"Marine Drive for me is the best stress buster I have around. This place is just so calming, refreshing and enjoyable. Being to marinedrive is always good to relax and de-stress yourself may it be any season, ofcourse the monsoon is the best."
One of the attractions of Mumbai fot its scenic beauty. A place worth visiting if you're in Mumbai. The queen necklace is mesmerising durin sunset and sunrise
"marine drive is the best place to visit when you in mumbai, even before the sea link this was the most important tourist attraction of mumbai. many movies are shot at this iconic site of mumbai. go in the evenings to see the beautiful sunset and chill by the water. and little at the night go towards walkeshwar to view this marine drive in a new site ""The Queens Necklace."" it's beautiful."
"Marine Drive is busy with vehicles and people. There is a nice wide promenade along the seafront, and often a nice sunset"
Watching sunset on marine drive is amazing. You can walk for a hour with beautiful sea view and feel great! Only missing part was absence of local vendors with amazing local food.
"Not exhilarating, but good to get a wider view of the city. Apparently and unfortunately could be a lot more impressive minus the smog haze."
"in the daytime, the area is very quiet but it comes alive at night. go to the beach and try the street food"
"Typical Mumbai walk and hang out spot for locals. Boardwalk of Mumbai. Beautiful sunsets. Many dogs, joggers, lovers, and families."
Best for sunrise and sunset walks Lots of people come for walks jogs and catch up with friends Good relaxing atmosphere
"Marine drive is in a true sense Queen's necklace, a place where you can form memories. It doesn't have a beach access but staying in the promenade and listening the soothing sea sound makes you peaceful and happy. You can sit relax talk discuss walk meditate, do cycling and lot of things. It is cleaner , walkable from Churchgate station, beautiful view of governors bungalow and a long stretch of footpath. Whenever you need peace, whenever you want to relax just be there"
Perfect place for Morning Joggers and Evening Walkers. Beautiful sea overlooks. Very clean and located near to Business hub like Nariman Point and Colaba.
Best time to visit is before sunset. Just feel the sea breeze and watch the huge Arabian see.As the sun goes down the crowd increases and the semilunar shape of the city lights up like a queens necklace.You feel so peaceful inspite of surrounded by people.The queen necklace view is actually jaw dropping.when in marine drive rustoms ice cream is a must try.
"I guess this is a place you need to visit at night. Unfortunately we only drove along the length of it during the day so I can only say 'been there, done that'"
"This is one of the famous places in Mumbai. It has a beautiful never ending sea view. It has a very long stretch of pathway surrounding the Arabian Sea which resembles like a Queen 's necklace.Night time is a best time to see it.we walk thereand visited many places near marine drive such as Narima Point, Malabar hills, babulnath temple etc. all places have more crowd and no privacy . I don't like these places. It is a safe place and one thing is best of this place is many Bollywood stars are also walk there in early morning jogging."
"One hour of Mumbai evening should be spent here . The sea , the sea breeze and the lighted long pavement with sea side seating on embankment. Line of couples both young and old and intermingled with evening walkers and jogger’s . Chalna jour garam and man watching or watch the sunset ... choice is yours ."
Stayed at a hotel on marine drive. To wake up to the view is amazing. Love the way it lights up at night. A must if you are visiting Mumbai.
"I was incapacitated and sitting in my room in the Intercontinental hotel and I had a great view of the bay. Not a moment passed when there was something to watch, a constant procession of colourful families and young people walking up and down, especially at weekends and evenings. There was constant beeping from the traffic along Marine Drive which lends an atmosphere at night."
"If you are in Mumbai, you must visit this place. A great place to be at in the evening. You can go for a walk, sit and watch sunset, relax and listen to music... whatever. You won't be disappointed."
"I was told that the view at night when it lit up like a necklace is amazing, but as I could only visit during the day I was disappointed. The sky was heave and gray from pollution. Impossible to take a photo."
"I walked it during the day and then Amish from Mumbai Moments took me up to a great spot after dark and showed me the Queens Necklace. A more spectacular scene, I have never seen. The lights of Bombay reflected in the Sea. If you go to Bombay, you cannot miss the beauty of Marine drive during the day and Queens Necklace by night.I didnt take any pictures of the Queens Necklace, I will for ever have the beauty of that scene forever etched in my mind."
An iconic road along the arabian sea in south mumbai also called the queens neclace die to the glitter of lights by night.
"It's awesome. Popularly known as queens Necklace. It's very nice and has a soothing effect. Especially evenings are even nicer. Just be careful don't stay very late night. Great view, fresh sea breeze and nice topography."
An evening in Marine drive Mumbai is fabulous.Very beautiful view in night. Lot of shops and eatery's around.
A great place to spend the evening with family. Vendors are there to serve tea and light tit bits.one can see the famous Queens Necklace.
This place is very good to visit as it gives good sea view aa it is very near to sea and also very old and haritage.
We visited this place at around 11 pm at night and found this place very happening.we also saw string of pearls around this place.
"Awesome place to sit and relax on the edge wall, hanging your feet onto the sea side and have a great life thought. Approx 10 mins walkable distance from churchgate local railway station."
"I visited this place after 1 am to experience the wind and sea noise to nurture mind, well the wind actually works your some part of mind would relax just sitting there and doing nothing"
Who doesn't like to sit somewhere close to nature.Marine Drive is basically the perfect place to sit to chill and get relief from chaos.I am very frequent visitor to this place.Mostly we drive at night with friends and sit there for hours just fell the beautiful breeze and sound of deep ocean.
"My favourite place in Mumbai. Have walk on this promenade any hours of the day. One of the safest places in Mumbai. Also know as Queens Necklace for the street lights in the center of the C shaped road. If you want to watch the most beautiful sunset, this is the place. Red Sun going into the Sun is worth watching. If you are visiting Mumbai must spend some time here."
"The Marine Drive is a must walk drive in Mumbai, same way as you love to walk around the Pondicherry beach or the Chennai Marina beach. It's beautiful, not a dull moment as you watch the waves kissing those huge boulders and stones and watching the sunrise or sunset. Unfortunately, we could not enjoy the Sun, but the feel and momentum of the place were unforgettable."
Avoid going to this place. Known as marine drive. Its very famous but police is not taking care of this place. Its not so safely. The guys sitting there are very bad and they are robbers. Its danger to be on marine drive now a days with young kids and families.
A nice Sunday afternoon spent walking along the seafront admiring the views and the expensive residences littered along the way. Be careful if you are a smoker as you will be fined - not all lost as you can always bribe the officials (who are already on a good salary) and this is easy money for these jobsworths so you can get away with paying half the amount of the fine...
"A wonderful sineary of sea give a exceptional joy and the dazzling air let you relax you can walk along it give you relax feeling can seat there as much you want, can think about yourself nicely.Good place to visit in Mumbai"
A place where relations are created. A place where people hangout with their loved ones. A walk by the sea with fresh breeze is always the best with the sound of waves and the feeling of sand on your feet
far too busy by any standards! I wouldn't rate food any special neither the crowd but I assume this is that Mumbai is!
With so much hustle n bustle here we come across varied people !! A good walk along the seaside .. the sound of waves . Breeze .. children .. elders A place for all age group ... a place where anyone and everyone can enjoy to the fullest !! Neat n clean a good place for walkers n jogger’s also
"When you feel hot anywhere in Mumbai,, Go there and feel fresh and cold air... As my title says,, my favorite place is Mumbai and Marine drive..."
Take a stroll down the Queens Necklace in the last hour or two before dusk ... see Mumbai's young and those who are tretching their legs. All of Mumbai is to be seen here!
See the beautiful skyline and sea shore from Marine Drive... so lovely and even more beautiful at night with the lights shining on the buildings ...
This is a beautiful road arena in South Mumbai easily accessible from the Mantralaya & Churchgate station. There are ample number of walkers and visitors enjoying a stroll & the sea breeze here in the evenings . Makes for a lovely drive too
Love the art deco architecture...aptly called the Queen's Necklace. Beatiful at monsoon time ...and the tetrapods are iconic too
What else to add ? Just find time take a leisurely walk for the entire 3km stretch in the evening. End with dinner at the Pizza by the Bay.
The best view of town side of mumbai. The queens necklace can be seen. Its so beautiful. Loved it. Very nice place
You haven't seen Mumbai if you haven't been here. Aptly named the Queen's Necklace. Take a drive/walk/jog/run here and relax your mind. Sit and watch and here the shores breaking on the rocks. A definite must visit in Mumbai.
"From hustling and bustling of the city this place gives peace. Early mornings one will find people jogging, running, exercising and all. As the day progresses you will find few tourist and lot of young couples and college students. In the early hours of night around 8.00pm onwards it will he busy with children running around and people walking and talking. Marine drive lighting is also known as the Queens Necklace. One can see as yellow lights are all around."
"Walk along the Marine Drive in the evening. It is an experience to remember. It is full with people: talking, singing, sleeping, also sleeping dogs, playing children. A nice way to end a day in an otherwise hectic Mumbai."
This is the oldest landmark of Mumbai. Its clean. The skyline in the day is worth it. Come for a jog or a bike ride. Lot of restaurants around the place. Start from oberois and walk till the bridge. Even on Sat late nights this is happening and very safe.
Really its the life of mumbai city which never sleeps or rests.whenever u go there u will find crowed of every ages resting gossiping jogging and celebrating
This is a beautiful place to visit. Just as I had visualised from watching it in movies and TV. We enjoyed our visit so much.
"Incredibly long road especially in the heat. There’s not a great deal to do on the road and there’s only one section of beach at the far end. It’s very picturesque and apparently known by the locals as the Miami of Mumbai. Hotels, a few restaurants and wall the entire length . The area is predominantly used by young courting couples and joggers. Nice for a walk and a gentle sea breeze is welcome in the Indian heat."
A lot of effort has gone into keeping Marine Drive clean and tidy. It feels safe and it’s a great for a stroll day or night. Worth a visit
"Marine drive is one of the best place to visit in South Mumbai. Also known as queens necklace, this place has its own charm. We usually end up going there, be it for a morning walk or just to relax with a sight of waves & sunset. The vibes & feel is really something different & soothing."
"If you want a peace of mind, If you are tired and want some really fresh air, then this is the place for you. a calm seaside with amazing rock structures. the marine drive is a prime location for peace lovers. the beautiful sunset is a must watch thing."
"The iconic landmark of Mumbai and India just next to another iconic 5* hotel, The Taj. The place is simply beautiful particularly in the evening and nighttime. Great place for relaxation."
"We have been visiting Mumbai regularly for some time. Our latest was this month and we were staying in a hotel right on Marine Drive. We would walk their entire length of Marine Drive (about 7km round trip) every morning. In the past we have found it to be a struggle. It has been dirty, with lots of stray dogs, street sleepers and dog and human poo everywhere, topped off by spittle sprayed by those munching on the horrible pan masala. This time however, it was different - better in many respects. Municipal workers cleaned the trash from the night before each morning, there were just a few stray dogs and there weren’t many sleeping it rough either. There was still poo and spit marks on the walkways but it was unlike the “hazard course” it was previously. Marine Drive is really a first class tourist attraction for Mumbai and it’s pleasing to see that the Authorities have taken genuine interest in keeping it clean. My only suggestion is more trash cans perhaps at every 100 meters to encourage the more lazy mumbaikers to dispose the trash responsibly."
The some kilometer long Marine Drive has been renovated and offers an excellent walk or jog along the seafront with the view of the famous Malabar Hill in the background across the bay.
"One of the most famous features of the city and provides outstanding views of the Arabian Sea and the promenade. Has been aptly known as the ""Queens Necklace"" and is lovely to visit at any time of the day or night."
"arrive a bit before sunset to reserve your spot (and don't miss sun, since it will set in the smog;). nice place for a walk/run (in the morning). quite wide, so it's not too crowded. really liked it!"
It was a wonderful experience to explore the evening sunset in such a beautiful seashore.. Strongly recommended one of the best place in mumbai
"Taking a walk along marine drive late at night was such a delightful site . Young frens ,old couples all just relaxing on marine drive. Tea sellers as well as ""messeaurs "" offering their services to all and sundry . I took the opportunity of having the foot massage done ,and was it gud and cheap . Loads of police patrolling the area so safety is almost guaranteed . Lots of fun while relaxing at the water on marine drive . A must do while in Mumbai"
"It’s a great place to unwind and get away from your worries. It’s very popular amongst the locals. People come here to jog, to gossip, to make out you name it. Their are no specific activities on marine drive. It’s just walk that makes it attractive. One side is the sea and the other side are the hotels and restaurants."
"This is place, that gives not just Mumbaikar's but also every visitor time and place to sit on the long promenade and notice the difference between chaos and peace. If you sit facing the road with you back facing the sea, you will witness the maddening chaos of vehicles, people strolling alone or with company, sometime with their pets too. Whilst some people going about with their exercises and some doing nothing at all. Whereas, if you sit facing the sea, you can witness the sea waves sometimes calm, sometimes dancing with the Sun near its horizon or above and you will be able to catch up with the beautiful sunset too,, well almost. and then towards late evening when the street lights are lit, they illumine the entire promenade stretch which make it look like a necklace with diamonds. Its beautiful visual treat. Day or night, Marine Drive is always alive with people from all walks of life, who come there for their share of peace."
"Best place to do jogging relaxing viewing the sunset. Best place for lovers and newly weds, honeymoon couples this is one of the best visited places in Mumbai Sit and enjoy your love life with your girlfriends or boyfriends. My favorite place to enjoy relax talk and admire my girlfriend is Marine Drive where I can sit with her for hours and you don't know when the time passes by."
"This is a nice place for a walk in Mumbai! People will stare a lot if you're white, but you get used to it. People may also want to take pictures with you, but that was fun! We didn't have any bad experience with taking pictures with people (no scamming, tricking etc.), just genuine and curious people."
Sunsets here are beautiful but because of the contamination of the city the sun disappears in a kind of mist. The place haves long and we’ll maintain sidewalks to enjoy so I would blinded recommend this place to watch the sunset.
It’s dreamlike here. We went at night so take a private car tour for safety and sit on the sea wall like a local!
"This is one of my favorite parts of Mumbai. Everytime I am here, I try and spend a couple of hours sitting on the drive and watching the sun rise and the city waking up. A must do activity early in the morning if you are in the city. The local wandering vendors serve tea and coffee that just hits the spot. Plus the place is super clean and wide paved space for an early morning or evening walk / run."
"Breathtaking wieve you will get specially from Trident Hotel side. Best to be seen at night, you can stroll late night till 1am"
The authorities have done very well creating this space for people to walk and sroll during their leisure time. Very enjoyable to jog along here but ONLY during weekdays and in off peak hours. It is for this reason i have rates it a 3 as its impossible during weekends evenings or on a public holiday to do much but join the hoards of happy people and stroll at snails pace. The demand for this type of place to walk in Mumbai is huge and it a great shame that when building the road out into the sea to the north a promanade was not attached for pedestrians as that would have been a marvellous attraction.
"Marine drive is a stretch of road between Malabar hills at one end and Nariman Point at the other. It runs along the coast on a reclaimed land. There’s a concrete made sidewalk or walking lane meant for strolling, walking, jogging or running or to sit on the benches and enjoy the breathtaking sea view and sunset. Post sunset the street lights light up the area and the curved road seems like a necklace, hence the name Queen’s Necklace."
Over the weekends Marine Drive is like an ongoing carnival. People sitting and chatting facing the limitless sea. Some just meditative. Most others breaking into loud laughs and a cheery mood. Kids running along the clean broad mostly well maintained promenade. Dogs of all breed & sizes being walked along turns out to be a great treat for dog lovers. Some young folks come out with their guitars and strum along singing flawlessly an Arijit Singh number. Marine Drive is buzzing over the weekend and the lovely hush of wind that plays along is sure to be a mood changer for you. While on Marine Drive don’t miss the breathtaking sunset !
"I have been coming here for years now; however even now it is a source of joy and relaxation for me. I have special memories of Marine drive since before my marriage I used to meet my fiancee here. It's road by the seaside and one can sit by the sea side, watching the sea waves on one side and the vehicles as well as people on the other side. Breeze from the sea continuously refreshes you. Very photogenic spot too. Large promonade where lots of people do exercise or a leisure walk. Watching Marine drive at night is an experience in itself since the street lights across the road look like queen's neckless."
Beautiful scenery and an amazing place. Nice place to have an evening walk and to catch a beautiful glimpse of the ocean and city life too.
"On any guide to Mumbai you will find Marine Drive up there as a top thing to see. Well, in my opinion, it’s not. We got a cab to the Air India office and walked down to the beach approx 1mile. The only people we saw “enjoying “ the view were students who were clearly having a self imposed day off from college/uni. The view was ok, but the thing that sticks in my mind most was the stiff onshore breeze carrying an overpowering smell of oil."
"Marine drive is one of the most prettiest ocean shore located in a city, filled with tri legs shape stones, filled with crowd, couples kissing holding hands, singles teasing them or taking selfies. A view with the diversity, if you reach here you will see many kinds of people, rich and poor, everyone is enjoying the sweet sound of sea waves, at night streets light make the area more beautiful, I can spend whole day here, DO YOU :)"
"It’s a wonderful place to unwind yourself. If you are in Mumbai, you must visit this place. Best time to visit is after 8 PM till early morning. You will never find this place to be isolated. Tides of sea not only hits the shore but also washes off all your tiredness and worries. It’s really very relaxing to spend time at Marine Drive. You get adequate place to park your car but I would suggest you to take Taxi (Black/White, Ola or Uber). Alternatively one can also get down as Churchgate Railway Station to reach Marine Drive."
Marine drive is popular all over mumbai. Be it rains or anything this place is always seen full. The beauty of sea with a great drive way this is one of the most cozy and popular places in mumbai to visit. Whankede stadium is also located here. Great sunset and sunrise can be seen as well as a good jogging track and playing area is also there.
"This is very good place to visit in evening and sit there till late night. You will enjoy air, sea and environment. It is highly recommended place to visit when you are in Mumbai."
A nice drive or walk or stroll along the beach not much else to do ! But enjoy the view and as you know it will always be a warm day
"You can never go wrong with a visit to Marine Drive !! The view, the atmosphere, the people, it will all recharge you. And this time around i noticed there were less street vendors there as well. So lesser garbage and the area looked so much clean. A must visit place."
"We were passing by this place and saw many people walking in the morning. You can park your car, take a walk and that would be great. Even to drive in Marine drive is an amazing experience"
"Nothing very much special, I enjoyed the local crowd in the evening. To have some peace of mind among all the hustles and bustles of Mumbai city, this can be a good option!"
marine drive is a good place for evening walks a beautful view of city lights n also good for friends to sit n chat for a long time . nobody misses on photo at marine drive a must visit in mumbai
"Marine Drive, One Of The Coolest Spots Of Mumbai, Marine Drive Is Arabian Sea Facing Tourist Spot, With Few Kilometres. This Places Is Beautiful During Night Times :) This Drive Contains Wankede Stadium, Dome Intercontinental Hotel Etc Transport - Nearest Station Marine Lines Station West (Western Railways) Fews Minutes Walking From Station."
The place offers calm view of sunset along the seashore popularly known as Queen's Necklace. Its a good place to be in the evening as the road gets illuminated with the street lights and the view is the best.
"Mumbai has the finest collection of Art Deco buildings in Asia. Marine Drive has a long, long string of them, overlooking the Arabian Sea"
This iconic landmark is a must visit. Best time to go is early in the morning for a jog or during sunset.
you dont need a reason to visit this place. just hangout with family friends and couples. enjoy sunset here
one of the best places in Mumbai!! !!I usually prefer to go at night....absolutely awesome place...arabian sea on one side n the beautiful Mumbai on other side....You enjoy the citylights...the cool breeze....very refreshing...it brings out the sentiments of every person...it rejuvenates you...its the iconic place of Mumbai....pinnacle of Mumbai.......certainly not to be missed!!!!!
"A nice place for a quiet stroll, just not sure at what time of the day as it appears to be busy 24 hours a day with people having a stroll. Nice spot anyway."
Marine drive is an awesome place to hang out friend your mind get fresh and sight seeing is awesome. Thank you
Nice area for a stroll during the day or at night along the sea. The pedestrian walkway is clean and spacious. Many tourists and locals and couples would come and just sit and enjoy the view. It gets pretty crowded at night so I suggest going earlier like in the morning or during the day to avoid the crowds.
"For the last 10years, we always return. Beautiful view from the Intercontinental hotel. Worth the trip as always."
"Monsoon Mornings at the Marine Drive are magical. The city's fitness conscious are out, the fresh spray hits you as you walk briskly all the way from NCPA, the southern most tip of Marine Drive all the way up the 8 km stretch to Malabar hill, past the Governors residence and up to the Hanging Garden. Treat yourself to a south Indian meal at Dakshinayan to celebrate your fitness levels."
"If you manage to go there when there are no other people around, then consider yourself lucky. Its the favourite haunt of people who want to kill some time without spending any money in Mumbai."
Does this place need a review at all? With all the bollywood shoots happening here it is a must place to visit. Do visit at night and from top if possible. Visit when you have time at your hand. Then only you would be able to soak in the place. You kind of realize this place has seen generations.
All the route parallel to the sea is very nice! There are a lot to places to stop and take pictures on the way!
Have Been A Lot Of Time To This Beautiful Place. At Night Is A Pure Beauty To Watch. Sitting Spending Time Here Looking At The Sea Is An Amazing Experience. Walking By The Sea Through This Amazing Place While The Cool Sea Breeze Passes By You Would Surely Make You Feel Peaceful
I was surprised just how busy this place was. Marine Drive itself if huge but there were people from end to end! There is not really much to see here but it is worth making a visit to watch the sunset from the massive sea wall. We joined the crowds to watch the sunset then made a stop at a rooftop bar at one of the hotels on Marine Drive to people watch. Don't let the crowds out you off - it is a really relaxed atmosphere and nice to see so many people enjoying the lovely views.
"A staple of Mumbai is the waterfront. It's pleasantly available to the public and usually crowded, though the enormous length of it allows the crowds to spread out over a wide area. I saw a guy walking his monkey on this walkway."
Take a stroll on Marine Drive from Nariman Point to Chowpatty to experience a local hang out. Along the way you can stop by the beach and dip your toes into Back Bay.
"Marine Drive - The heart of Mumbai!!! This is the city which never sleeps and if anytime you want to get some fresh air, have a stroll by yourself or with family or friends - Marine drive is the place. I have always visited during the night time and I just love it here. It is my favourite place in the whole Mumbai and am sure many share the same feeling. At any time of the day or eve or night, one can come here and just relax and have a great time. Be it with your girlfriend/boyfriend or friends or spouse or faily - this place is for everyone without any age bars. Everybody loves being here. It also offers a lot of dining options along with the mesmerizing view of the city and the nice breeze and a walkfront."
"I live in Toronto but every time I visit Mumbai I love walking along the Marine Drive. It is nice, long and romantic. There are plenty of luxury hotels nearby to have dinner and enjoy the view at night. If you have a chance to have tea by the water do it."
"Great place to chill out. So many locals gather and relax by the marina. Lots of great food at beach. Very clean and very unexpected from india..it does not feel as it you are in India, especially on weekends."
"Not clean as such, but you can sit there and stare at water and spend hours and hours just by staring at it. It looks so beautiful especially at time of sunset."
"There isa good view of the hanging Gardens and downtown Mumbai from this beach. It's nice to have a stroll on and full of locals, but I wouldn't swim in the water."
"This is a must visit place for anyone who wants to claim to have seen Mumbai. This is one of the tourist destination and one of the Tourist Spot that you may have visited if you have taken a Mumbai-Darshan bus. But, these buses, typically bring tourists during afternoon. The real charm of Marine Drive is either in early morning - when many Mumbaikars visit this place for a Jog / Morning Walk, or during the evening. It is particularly beautiful during the evening since you can enjoy the sun setting in to the sea. After sunset the yellow street lights placed on the road that runs along the sea shore come alive - and this transforms Marine Drive in to a Golden Necklace. You can see shape of the necklace clearly if you are at the end, near Nariman Point. The necklace looks complete with a brilliant pendant which is nothing but beautifully lit-up Saifee Hospital near Charni road station. This is definitely a place to visit again and again."
"Once known as the Queen's Necklace, now a huge promenade with some of the really toniest parts of downtown draped to one side. Great drive, great view, great place for morning and evening walks."
"I stayed near to marine drive so I along with my family have a break n walk on marine drive very early in morning 4 am. That time too u can't say it's night time. Marine drive was still alive cool wind. Here u can enjoy leg n head massage, tea,coffee, chana jor garam etc at such morning time along with lovely walk of marine drive."
The evening and late night walk on this beach is very beautiful. The best part is the place has a very good scenic view of the street lights which resembles the necklace pearls.
If you are in mumbai then you have to visit the marine drive. Try the food at Chowpatty and also visit the Taraporwala aquarium on Marine drive. Its also called Necklace as its looks like one at night.
This 3.5 km stretch in Bombay is best visited early morning and at night. Its is known as the Queen's Necklace because it looks like a string of pearls from an elevated point. Great view of Nariman Point and Malabar Hill from here.Great place to walk in the morning !!
Its a good place with breeze. You can relax a bit here. Must visit place in Mumbai in day and night.
"If you have not been to Marine Drive while in Mumbai, you have not seen the MUMBAI.... This is the ultimate view you can't miss....and you get it all for FREE!!!! this place has the true spirit of this city....where everone, no matter you are rich, poor, black/white, from any religion, caste, city country.....You get the same fresh breez from the sea, lovely view of Queens neckless and ultimate feeling of nature!! Best time would be to come during peak of Monsoon, to enjoy the rains of Mumbai with Sea waves!!!! Just wonderful, words can't describe it."
After the renovations the place is much more clean and maintained. the seating has become much better and also the pavement is good for walking and jogging. the view is amazing and the breeze during the rainy season is just too good
Its best place in Mumbai to sit and relax after a tiring day. You will find people staying here all night long and even at 3 am u will find it lively and filled with Mumbai spirits. Truly Mumbai never sleeps. There are nice food joints nearby like chote miya which are open whole night and u can even try church gate station small joints of sandwiches and vada pav if u feel hungry at 3 am..
Most visited place ..one can't miss this in mumbai...lots of activities ...gateway of India nearby ....opposite the famous Taj and good place for quick outing fresh air and lovely view of city and ocean
A place to spend a solace with family. A place to spend private moments with a special one. A place where every Mumbaikar after working hard the whole day spend a few moment to breadth fresh air. A place where every college going students spend quality time bunking their lectures with their friends. A place where beautiful moments getting wet during the monsoon season can never be forgotten. A place where every Indian citizen when travel to Mumbai longs to visit. A place where even politician could not resist saving BMC cost on street lights. A place which shines bright like a well dressed bride every night. Rightly named as Necklace of the Financial Capital city of the nation.
"If you'd like to walk along the ocean in Mumbai, then Marine drive is a great place in South Bombay for walking, running, biking, picture taking. It's a 5k walk from Chowpatty beach to the National Center for the Performing Arts (NCPA) and back. Best done at sunrise or sunset."
"Amazing view during evening, though the colour of necles has been changed from yellow to white!!! Gr8 place to just hang around with family, friend or with someone special in your life..."
An excellent glimpse of the old & new along the marine drive. Great sight at night with the lights along the Queen's Necklace
"If you are into walking or jogging this is a long flat run with the beach on one side. Being Independence day holiday, it was busy with people, but that made it more interesting. After the end of the beach, the sea was a bit smelly."
"We left the Hotel early in the morning and all we could see along the Marine Drive were people jogging, walking and doing their gymnastic skills in exercising, while others were just sitting and enjoying the view. its a magnificent view of the 4.3 kilometre Marine Drive and Arabian Sea. Its a must see and is located at South Mumbai."
"Marine Drive is situated over reclaimed land facing south-west Arebian Sea. We walk through the Marine Drive from its Southern end called Nariman point to its Northern end at Girgaon choupati. This road gives amazing scenery worth relishing! The cool breezes and sound of the waves keep cool and relax all the time. Viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace so it is also known as the Queen's Necklace. The official name for this road is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Road. During the monsoons this road gives amazing scenery but take care because water splash out though loud wave on the walkway. Keep drinking water."
I fell in love with Marine Drive the first time I went there. It's so peaceful to just sit there at sunset and watch the whole stretch light up. Do spare a few hours to walk there and just be a part of Mumbai :)
Its a major attraction in Mumbai. The cool breeze makes it a nice place to hangout with friends. The eating options are limited but you can get street food.
this is one of the main attractions of mumbai and is also known as the queens necklace as when lighted at night it looks like a queens necklace. marine drive is next to the chaupati beach which is famous for chat and usually people like to have a long walk by the marine drive.
Well. . Mumbai has one advantage over most of cities..marine drive.. What a view.. Just sit and relax..enjoy endless view of the sea.. But of course..you have to visit in evening..
"The famed Queen's Necklace is the quintessential tourist destination for first time visitors to Mumbai. Named so because of it's appearance as a pearl necklace when lit up at night, the Marine Drive promenade is a must see. The sea spray may carry stink, but the breeze and the open sea view make up for that. Must visit for all, Mumbaikars and tourists alike."
"Mumbai feels like one of the hottest places on the planet - the heat is unrelenting and you crave an escape from it. Despite there being water all around Mumbai, there's nowhere to swim. Why? Because most Indians appear to have a terrible short-sighted and individualistic approach to the environment and have polluted the water to the point that no-one can swim. As such, the beaches are just hot stretches of sand with people selling things and young couples sitting around while the traffic whizzes noisily past on the other side. India, you need to start caring for the environment!!"
"Great scenic beauty, leading to the hanging gardens. Always crowded with visitors. Beautiful view of the sea and next to the great 26/11 Taj."
Truly this is not only the most famous road in Mumbai but across India.. Its part of almost every hindi film which depicts mumbai city .. visit it during evening / night .. lots of bustling activities and street side food.
"midnight walks are amazing experience.. Cutting chai must have, try foot and head massage from local massage walas..sitting on the sidelines of arabian sea with winds blowing is an experince not to be missed.. safe place nothing to worry about.. do not miss"
A little bit of peace and serenity in this bustling city. You can enjoy a cup of tea from the local vendors and have a snack or just sit on the huge rocks and just enjoy the view!
"On the bank of Seashore are several Shivlinga are out.That is one of the attraction of marine drive.On high tide people of mumbai come to watch and do photography of it.You can see real magic at night when the light is on,looks like necklace."
"The magic of Marine Drive (MD) is, by giving a glance while moving by taxi-car, you will think it’s so crowded.. But that’s not the case... Facing sea (especially sunset time or monsoon time), that’s the feeling... that I can’t explain it.. That is my fav place in Mumbai... Yeah there is Sea link-carter road-Juhu-Powai Hiranandani-parel Mill area.. Vashi necklace road... But nothing can beat vibe of marine drive. You can sit there, sleep there... (That is very wide slab)... Chatting with friends but what I prefer, just sit there and listen soothing songs... I can spend hours by doing so... It is also very good place for photographers.. They have sufi hospital, nariman point building and of course vast sea.. On occasion, like Diwali or any festive season, they can get very good clicks.. If anyone don’t have any companion, he/she can come and spend some time here.. no one here bother to look in your life… On 12/31, it has different charm.. It has very good restaurant around it. Natural ice-cream parlor, pizza by d way are among lots. This is paradise for joggers. I used to stay there late like till 3-4 and catch first local from CST. Once I slept there ;) so I am counting that day as struggle..haha.. Tip- after 2, police will make you leave that place but only from 2-3. After 3, you can come again. YOU ARE WELCOME."
Marine drive in the early morning is a refreshing experience.Park your car near NCPA Free parking and take a healthy walk or jog down the promenade.The walkway is marked every hundred meters so you can actually measure your distance. A walk from NCPA to princess street flyover and back is 4 km. You can reward yourself by having a nice buffet breakfast at Hotel Marine Plaza.600 plus tax.It fun to be there especially on Sunday morning
"Be it a relaxing morning walk or after dinner fast pacing, I always wonder how it can be always so refreshing. Best place to chill-out in drizzling monsoon months. Proud to have such a place which is called Queen’s necklace of Mumbai city"
good fresh air off from the town hustles and bustles where you can sit and enjoy the view. evening times you can also find some snacks and tea passing by where you can enjoy sipping while watching sun go down (nothing beats the street tea)
"Amidst the chaotic and busy lives, life stands still here and u get your breathing space. Go at nights. MIght seem like a place for couple... but equally nice place with friends and even better alone.. A time to think, introspect and sea breeze along with it"
I love this place very much. This is the heart of Mumbai. Unless one can visit the place you can not imagine the value of this place.. You.At night 11:30pm also marine drive will be filled with people gathering with family friends. This is walking distance from Chowpaty beach.
"A short span drive along with sea phase, makes you relax in city. Marine drive is more beautiful in evening as many enjoys sun set here. The wind, sunset & amazing drive is nice experience. In rainy season Marine drive has it's incredible experience. Things you may do at Marine Drive 1. Walk on Marine Drive in Rain (MUST TRY) 2. Sit relax & watch sunset 3. Photograph yourself with Queens necklace 4. Fireworks, lanterns in New Year 5. Tea at Marine driver in night 6. Brunch at ""Pizza by the Bay"""
"A place you can walk, sit, watch, relax n be yourself.. You can be there for hours, well I sit there till morning when ever I'm there :) One should spend sometime there to feel it.."
"I decided by looking at the map that I would walk this piece of coast, you know what they say about mad dogs and English men! It was like walking a desert and by the end the heat had really taken its toll. Really nice to be next to the sea where the din of traffic is softened and if I hadn't been moving from shade to shade (mostly commandeered by couples and sleeping locals) I would have been able to take more in."
"You don't need anyone's company or any reason to be here. All you need is your soul. Cool breeze, floating water and alike people wandering in their own thoughts. Overall a perfect place to sneak out of your busy schedule and sit here for no reason."
"One of the most popular walkway in Mumbai at the coast of Arabian Sea. Famous among couples, joggers and tourist this walkway comes alive in morning and evening. It provides Panasonic view of the city."
"Brilliant, and amazing. The Mumbai culture and its people at their best in this great place. You see everything, couples, old, rich, super-rich, and children- all and the view in the morining and night is really cool."
"This is one place which has been called as the Queen's necklace since the British times due to the form the drive takes. High speed cars flash you by the road as you stroll on the well maintained cobblestoned walk paths. Facing the sea, it is a great place to unwind. Tourist police patrols make sure the place is safe for joggers and people taking a stroll."
"a long stretch overlooking the Arabian sea- Marine Drive is the perfect place for a walk. markings at every 200m let you know how much you've walked. when u get tired you can sit down on the boulevard along the sea shore. In the evenings, the citylights create a magical environ."
"I am only going to add the myself amonsgt the long list of people who find Marine Drive simply amazingly and calmingly peaceful. For a background, I have been true Mumbaikar for 22 years before settling abroad, and to this day, I miss the place without any respite. The best time to visit MD (as its called locally) is at night, when the locals are out for a peaceful walk with their loved ones, or sitting with friends chatting about their day or the elderly relaxing after a long and hot day. MD means a lot of things to a lot of people. For me, MD gave me a lot of hope for future in my bad times, while I walked over its ramparts contemplating my future. Miss it very much.!"
This place is a favorite place for all locals. Locals come here to bask in the calmness of the sea & tourists come here to enjoy the view of Mumbai's most famous Queens Necklace. You can find hawkers roaming with local food here. Marine Drive is always a good idea. But the best time to visit is Early Morning or Night when the temperature is not high. The best season to visit this place is rainy season. The city looks beautiful from here during rains.
"Marine Drive is a rare place in Mumbai where you have a sense of space and openess. It's no Las Ramblas in Barcelona, but it's where you can walk a long promenade by the Arabian Sea, mix with others of a similar mood (there's far fewer hawkers and beggars than elseweher in Mumbai), enjoy the view across the water, catch a refreshing breeze when there is one, and enjoy the evening when the street lights turn it into Victoria's Necklace (best enjoyed from high up, such as the InterContinental's Dome Bar). It's also a place where you see courting couples and exercise junkies in equal measure. But also note that it's not a quiet place, as Marine Drive is part of Mumbai's constant traffic jams and car horns. Nor is it tourist friendly - a few more seats and vegetation would help in this regard, and on air polluted days you may have difficulty seeing the far shores with any clarity. Overall, Marinbe Drive should be experienced as a rare commodity in mad frenetic Mumbai."
Great place to go really buzzing Make sure you go to sky bar in four seasons hotel And a great place food with a buzz and not forgetting haji Ali . It make you think about life and appreciate more a must vist.
its a great place to roam around with gud restaurants around and for roaming or walks its a great place followed by street food like channe jorr garam and keri i suppose its like raw mangoes so i had a great time over there during my second visit
One of the most iconic locations of Mumbai - This location is best to experience the sunset - also try the 'Cafe by the Beach' which is nestled right at the end of the marine drive towards the charni road end.
"One of the must visit places in Mumbai. Be it unwinding or a romantic walk, this place is advisable. Do visit this place when you're in Mumbai. Best time to visit is before 10am or after 4pm."
"one of the best jogging routes, the sunsets are great, sit on the rocks and enjoy the cool arabian breeze and the cold water splashing around you,"
"Nice place to sit and watch the sea , take pics @ sunset , walk on the path way ... if watching sea become boring turn around and gaze away into the beautiful buildings in the surrounding area ,"
"Great place to visit in mumbai specially for morning walk or evening walk or night walk on sea face , great location, great feeling of fresh air, good to see sea specially on high tide"
Marine Drive is a tired soul's lighthouse! Vast expanse of sea on one side and wide roads with high speed traffic on the other with wafts of cool (holy?) breeze all around you bring the mind to a halt. Only wish that the traffic were a little lesser ...and there were majestic spas and sea side hangouts to lounge around. God Bless the Arabian Sea and God bless the mighty land
visited the seashore walk area as well as took a boat ride in the sea. excellent. it is one of the best sea beaches in urban areas of india
Marine drive is one place you must not miss if you are in Mumbai. A long stretch right beside the sea with a beautiful sight of Mumbai and pleasant breeze hitting your face. Have spent many a night outs here! Has left me spellbound every single time
"How I love the prince necklace :D Mumbai is beautiful and will always be my fav city. Full evening is not enough to spent here, better take out time to visit it and you will love it."
"Whenever in Bombay, do take an evening drive to Marine Drive. Just sit on the seafront, watching the beautiful sunset, the ripples on the sea and the glowing pearls on the legendary Queen's Necklace. No matter how hot it is during the day, evenings on the promenade are breezy and relaxing. Revel in the hustle and bustle of frantic joggers and romantic couples - and, if you feel adventurous, walk down to Chowpatty beach for some delicious chaat and awesome kulfis!"
A long walk and stretch is the best way to start a day for south mumbaians. 6-7 km long .. great getaway with friends
View and air are the high lights. donot see on the sea front - the concrete blocks. absolute filth and dirty - all kinds of plastic. during high tide some of it lands on marine drive.
"what i liked about marine drive is the roads, sea, good walking track very lively place in the night hot during day but sea breeze is very good. amazing for jogging and walking. only thing bad is some food sellers nagging for buying there food."
This is a nice place to visit for feel free your mind and have some Mumbai special traditional food items in the walkway.Big hotels and restaurants are there for stay and eat.Nice place to spent time.Good seashore.
The wide pavements allows for pleasant evening walks. it gives a good relaxing frame of mind. just the lighting is not the best as it was previously brightly light - now is seems a bit dimmer like they are using energy savers. the full impact of seeing the queen's necklace is lost
"What to say about this place.... You need to be their to feel and understand Mumbai! All n all .....who's who..... everybody is here! Irrespective of cast or creed, high or low.... Its THE place in Mumbai! A must visit to understand the life of metro! Anytime....be early morning or late night! Marine drive is alive....."
Marine drive is definitely on the list of all while going to Mumbai... However what most of the people don't know is that marine drive is excellent when visited early morning... The cool breeze and the sea view gives you comforting feeling... At the same time the joggers and morning walkers are inspiration...
"A beachside used in a totally different way from Copacabana, LA, Nice or Costa Brava. Few swimmers and nobody sun bathing. Still worth walking and seeing how much happens in that stripe of land which is part of the Mumbai lifestyle."
A must place to visit in mumbai..It has been called queens necklace .. Best thing to take a walk on sea face in winter..You would able to see full Arabian sea from here.. best thing to watch sun set at evening..A mind refresher .... Must visit once if you are in south Mumbai..
Free look at the sea :) Calming & relaxing. Nice & simple lighting. View of nice houses (which one can only dream of owing one day :-D ) .
one of the home of sea creature... staying here in moon night facing toward sea you can feel peace ful and relax mind... when waves coming toward u it will touch your heart ... enjoyable place
"Though the place is arterial road in mumbai, its still worth a stroll. Its bustling with people and one of the few places in mumabi where you can actually feel the sea breeze. View of skyline is nice and do enjoy local snacks (please use dustbins, they are provided all along)."
"I have been living in south mumbai for 30 years and i cant remember a time the queens necklace looked this sad, i really think the LED lights need to be done away with."
if you are in a couple then marin drive and banstand are the place for some good time. you can also hangout with your friends at this place. you will find the good crowd of mumbai but in the evening you may stuck in the traffic
marine drive was a place to walk without crowds and allowed you to take a stroll with ease it lead all the way to chowpatty beach and busier parts of town.
Loved the evening stroll down the path after enjoying the sunset at the beach. The Coast line is beautiful with the buildings stretching up in the distance. Seemed to be a great location for jogging as we passed plenty.
One part of Mumbai which is spacious and beautiful. Walk around the broad promenade and enjoy the view as well as the cool sea breeze.
"When In Mumbai, one must visit the Marine drive and especially in the night, to see the well lit, queens necklace. this is a serene sea promenade of Mumbai. you will spot a lot of people seeking privacy, people taking a walk, vendors selling some food stuff. Also opposite the marine drive is the famous ""K Rustom"" Icecream house, which also is a must try. Also feel like a king and queen and take the famous victoria ride on the promenade"
"Have a look at the this road from both the corners. It gives the feel of necklace and hence called as Queens Necklace. if you want to enjoy the sunset then this is the best place. Surrounded with aquarium, five star hotels, art theaters and most costly apartments in Mumbai."
The queen's necklace is a must visit place in Mumbai particularly in the evening. Many places to eat and good walk way to stroll around.
"Marine Drive, Mumbai, also known as Queen's Necklace was built during British times but was expanded and made more beautiful post independence. Its one of the star attractions in Mumbai, curling around the Arabian Sea. it's best viewed from the top of Malabar Hills from the Kamala Nehru Park. In the night, with all lights on, it really looks like a beautiful necklace."
"Marine Drive is a popular hangout spot in Mumbai, what it offers is a view of Arabian Sea and the Mumbai Skyline. The place can be pretty crowded, so it sometimes loses the purpose of just watching the endless ocean in peace. Nothing much else to do there. Go there after sunset for a better view and a cool breeze."
Beautiful seaside with modern buildings. Not much to do along the way. Good for outdoor activities and sports.
"must go 4 night drive. Looks awesome !!! lights add beauty to it.lots of places 2 eat out , one can even enjoy street food."
If you are in Mumbai and feel like doing some touristy stuff then this should top your list. It has enough to offer you as far as Mumbai's culture is concerned. One can also go for sailing on any of the yachts starting from gateway at a nominal price.
"This was part of the tour of Mumbai, it's a massive place to see in one day and this is one way to see a portion of the city. Flat and accessible. Sea views to one side and lovely buildings on the other, immense wealth amongst great poverty. The colour and contrasts of this city will stay with us forever. Magic and majestic, would love to see more some day."
"This long stretch of beach and sea is a welcome contrast to the hectic city streets of Mumbai. At night they call this ""The Queen's Necklace"" because street lights blaze all around the harbor creating a magical effect. Some of the most expensive real estate in the city is here with huge high rise apartment buildings. Fascinating!"
"Almost everyone who comes to Mumbai, visits the Marine Drive. walk, sit on a bench alone or move with friends or family, it is enjoyable with lots of people around you and hustle & bustle."
"Marine Drive is a 4.3-kilometre-long Queen's Necklace or ""C"" shape road in South Mumbai in the city of Mumbai. It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast well lighted, the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace. Beautiful place must visit in the evening. Marine drive is a good place for photographer enthusiasts. Place is well located with good hotels from high end to middle end. Parking is not a problem in the area. Nice restaurants are available in the location."
"Marine Drive (also known as the 'Queen's Necklace') is along the wide road that extends from Marine Lines (local railway station) till Churchgate and little beyond till NCPA (or Nariman Point), off course going along the sea. If you are in south Mumbai and wish to sit relaxing for a while with a nice sea-view then this is the place. The really long stretch of about 1.5km has ample sitting space and is 5 minutes walkable from Churchgate (local-railway station). On busy evenings there, you may need to walk a bit to find a good place (with some gap around) for you to sit comfortably. Hawkers keep approaching you who serve bhel, corn, salted peanuts n like items. So do beggars, esp. children whom you have to simply keep driving away. You can watch line up of good buildings on the other side of the road (tall Air India building, Trident hotel etc.) There is an Ice-cream outlet of popular 'Naturals' brand nearby, but no good restaurants or food stalls etc. (for which you may need to walk little more towards Girgaum Chowpaty side)."
"It was called ""Queen's Necklace"" when India was under British conqueror as the driveway shapes like a lady's necklace. I visited here around noon on a Sunday, when there were many young people hanging out together. The street was quite clean and peaceful. You can see the sea and the skylines of the city of Mumbai. Not many things to play out, but it would be a good place to enjoy serene and peaceful hours walking with your lover."
"Lovely to observe at night, from a height: try the top of the Intercon. It's aptly named ""The Queen's necklace""."
"a beautiful promenade for varied activities or just to relax. late evenings and weekends brings with it bundles of families/friends for evening outings, and hawkers setup shop for public to enjoy their favorite street foods."
"It is not protected with trees or shadows, so, be ready for hot! There is a nice view of the Skyline of Mumbai, it looks like Manhattan but buildings are not so tall. Many local people walking there, and going down to the water. If you like walking you can try to walk from Nariman Point (South) to the Beach on the North, but is a long walk! Be advised to bring some water and sun protection!"
Very nice view of the sea and Chowpatty! Nice place to relax on a night out (unless if it's too crowded). Can't hang around for too long. Makes a nice drive through!
seeing the marine drive from the tallest building in the area makes the place look like a giant necklace of shinning yellow gems a good place to hang out by the sea face
My wife and I get an absolute High when we drive or are driven on the beautiful Marine Drive in Mumbai. One reason for visiting Mumbai for us is to drive on this wonderful Queen's Necklace watching the beautiful Arabian Sea. The Mumbai Corporation or the Muncipality has always taken great care of this road and I have always marvelled at the cleanliness here in this otherwise not so clean city. It has a good footpath where one sees several people enjoy their morning walk and exercises. This area is easily the pride of Mumbai.
"One can spend hours just sitting there and looking at the sea. Its a marvelous sight, be it day or night. In fact at the night, when the street lights are on, its one sight all mumbaikars, and everyone who sees it, are in love with. It looks like a beautiful necklace around a queen's neck."
its a very good place to watch the sea beach and its hot point for loving birds in mumbai people use to come to enjoy their small happy moments.
Must visit this place Marine Drive.. You can sit and Relax and Enjoy the cool wind and sea waves. I would recommend to visit this place in morning or evening time but not in afternoon as its very hot during day time.
"Marine drive in Mumbai is a 4.3 Km long boulevard in the southern part of the island city forming a shape of ""C"". It stretches from Nariman Point to Malabar Hills, its a natural bay reclaimed from the sea. This goes almost all of the materialistic information's one need about the place but whats still unsaid is the beautiful promenade which runs along the road on the sea side and this promenade is the host to a number of activity 24 by 7. Surely there wont be a single day when there wont be a crowd and whatever time let it be. Early in the morning from the Nariman Point end of the stretch the city's skyline resembles to what we see of Newyork in the pictures and in the evening this place gives the best sight of sunset when the sun sets in the Arabian sea, and as the hue of setting sun fades away comes the ""queens necklace"" in existence. Yes i am talking about a necklace which is formed by the street lights.The street lights on a windy night seems like glittering diamonds or as if the stars have come down to lit up the scene. This stretch has some of the land mark buildings of the city like Air India building, Bombay Gymkhana to name a few and some hotels and restaurants have utilized this naturally beautiful place to the best of their interest like there can be nothing better than sitting in the cafeteria of Marine plaza and watching the sun set over the Horizon and sipping on your cup of choice(this is my favourite spot and i sip on a hard cup of freshly brewed coffee). And when talking about food how can i miss the pizzeria named ""Pizza by the bay"" which has turned into a land mark in itself with its glass covered wall one gets to enjoy the full view of sea and enjoy the food, One the other hands while these are the budget options we also have stalwarts like Trident or the hotel Ambassador on the same stretch of road.On the promenade one can just sit over the concrete fence and listen to the never ending and ever delighting sound of the sea, and enjoy the tea coffee and other savories being sold by street hawkers, if one goes there at night then trying the "" muska bun"" becomes a must. One can just spend the entire day over there it has got a plethora of activities to be witnessed and is always a delight choice for photo enthusiast, kids and last but not the least of many love birds of the city who after a long day comes over to share some quality time and soak in the unending energy from sea. Now lets move towards the chowpatty which is a fair arena more than a beach. Chowpatty is an identity of this city, one gets to taste all kind of food here junk foods are something that attracts a lots of tourist. During monsoon the stretch near Nariman Point becomes so livid with the sea splashing occasion splashes till the road.To sum up i would say that having seen many promenades in this country have never seen such a lively and socially mixed up one till now, to feel the life in this super fast paced metro city one got to spend a day here, an entire day round the clock. Being said all the only thing to beware of the touts who if you fall for can take you for a ride."
The hot weather was excruciating in Mumbai. We left from pune and it was a smooth drive. The traffic too was bearable. We were just roaming about the city when we just remembered that we were in the film city. We quickly changed our route and zoomed our way to marine drive. The winds were so soothing. I literally forgot that it was summer in Mumbai. We had a great experience. I would recommend a Sunday because the traffic is minimal.
It is beautiful part of arabean sea.It is in the heart of mumbai city.One of the main attraction of Mumbaities and visitor of mumbai.It has vast seaview you will find people from early morning joggers and all short of people of diffrent age.The scenic view is the main attracion.The sun rise and sun set viewing is astonishing.The people has given name as queens neclace as the raw of road light give impression of queens neclace.It has white light one upon a time but it has yellow golden light at present. A drive on this road brings cheerful mood.It has Nariman point at one end and Girgaon chowpatty at other end.It is must must to see place of mumbai.
"CLEAN, Airy, Quiet and Frequented by a good crowd. Despite being in Mumbai for only 6 months now, I'm already a fan. Can keep going back again and again"
Marine drive also called queens necklace is the most beautiful points in mumbai. Must visit in late evening. Very beautiful views. Also jogging paradise in morning
Its a good time pass place in Mumbai for weekends. Perfect sea view is the most attractive part of the area where you can fill actual Mumbai city..
This place is one of the best places to visit if you wish to escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life in the busy Mumbai city. Marine drive is a place to chill out with a bunch of good friends or a place to unwind with a loved one and watch the sun set on a beautiful Mumbai evening.. I would totally recommend going there anyday!
I stayed at the Four Seasons which was near the walking promenade for Marine Drive. It is clean and could be a great spot for a morning jog (although I slept in :))
"I guess that if you are coming from other parts of India, you will like it. But if you are a tourist that have been around the world, you will be disappointed : a lot of begging, dirty water and street, mostly men, a lot of poverty, etc. Don't come for this, not worthy."
"The drive stretches for over 4km. It is a lovely pace to stroll, even in part. There is always someone coming by with food or chai to purchase. Clean and spacious but don't be tempted to get in the sea when the tide is out, there is an open sewer in the middle! Stay on the drive and enjoy the view and people watching. Sunset is stunning here. Beware of the street children. They will smile and ask you to take their picture if you have a camera and then try and pick your pocket whilst you oblige! But don't be put off, it is safe and local people will look after you. At night there is amazing horse drawn carriage you can ride in, all lit up with neon!"
"Must visit place of mumbai. Just a cool breeze, and the open sky with the wide spread sea. Thats all to make you feel like heaven on earth. It is totally a rejenuvating experience"
"For all travel enthusiasts visiting Mumbai,a trip to the city is incomplete w/o a visit to Marine Drive.Its beauty is really unique as you sit on the pomenrade & watch the sun set on the waters of the Arabian Sea,a view so majestic.Accessible throughout other than b/w 2-4 am,its the place to be during the monsoon to see the actual beauty of the Arabian Sea.You have lot of local vendors serving tea,snacks & water so everything is available easily if you want to spend some time over there.For the original romantics,its a must on the menu."
Awesome place to visit Marine Lines area of Mumbai during late night time which will be a good opportunity to see entire area with sea ( Princess Neckless ) in lighting . Excellent place for evening walk with family ( teens ) to experience . This route links between Nariman Point to Babulnath temple . Good opportunity to see stunning sunset from here
"when viewed from atop malabar hill in the late evening or night , this is an apt sobriquet. the shimmering streetlights appear like a diamond jewel piece around a queen's neck.best for a long walk along the promenade taking in the salty sea spray.driving on it during peak hours is a different story altogether.A must for even the mumbai local populace which come from the far flung suburbs to spen a saturday or sunday evening. the trips usually culminate in the adjacent chowpaty beach where indian snacks like corn on the cob,bhel puri or gol guppas can be enjoyed."
"I thank my stars for landing me in government services,which I least liked, for they provided me with a decent living accommodation on the B ROAD in the famed Churchgate area on the MARINE DRIVE an area no common man can dream to live in for THIRTY YEARS at a starch. Every alternate evening it was our family's choice outing to sit and enjoy the setting sun on the Arebian sea , or a Bhutta soaked in monsoon rains, The magic changes with every changing second have patience to absorb it you will have all all hues of life on the pomernade of MARINE DRIVE in an hours time from Third page personalities to non entities mingling together on that QUEENS NECKLACE which is pride of my Mumbaim."
"This is one of my favourite places in mumbai. this is situated on the coast of arebian sea.you can reach here by train upto churchgate then, walking distance from chirchgate.Or if you are coming from cst then you can hire a taxi upto here,You will get all type of people like, youngsters, elders, children, foreigners hanging out here. you ll find gang of guys, familes, tourists, couples enjoying the cool breezes from the sea.people drive their car very fast on this road.You ll find all the expensive cars running on this road. As this road is curved in half circle ,the streetlights on this look like neckless of queen.In the monsoon during high tides you can enjoy the high waves here. You can walk along the marine drive or hire a taxi upto girgaon chowpati which is also a nice place to hang out with family."
"It's a beautiful stretch around sea...you have this platform where u can sit sea facing...watch sunset maybe....but you must walk or drive all the way to the end of it towards Nariman point, from where you have a 180 degree sea view..."
"It's a great view, it's a great feeling. Marine Drive is indeed the icon of Mumbai. And it's well worth the fame. If you're in a hurry, just drive by. If you have some time, do sit there and enjoy the peace this experience has to offer. Word of caution: there are many peddlers and beggars around. It would be best if you ignored them. Also, it's difficult to find dustbins, they're rare but they're there!"
We travelled a couple of times along Marine Drive and stopped to admire the Arabian sea and the shoreline. The cool breeze here was very welcome and it seemed to be one of the only streets in Mumbai where the traffic flowed rather than crawled. Stop here in the afternoon and take a stroll as we did. It makes you think the madness of Mumbai a few hundred yards away doesn't exist.
"Here's a tip if you're in Mumbai - take a taxi to the Intercontinental on Marine Drive around 5.30 and pop up to the rooftop bar. You can enjoy a cocktail with an uninterrupted view of the ocean and the sunset. Then pop across the road to the promenade and walk along the beach in the dusk, its full of families and couples and the food stalls will be opening. Get a takeaway with a difference for less than a £UK. While you're there you'll see the world's first billion dollar residence (apparently five people live there with over 30 staff). It's the real Mumbai - hyper rich living side by side with those who have absolutely nothing!"
Fantastic evening drinking Kingfisher on the roof terrace of The Intercontinental looking down on Diwali celebrations on the drive
"The curved stretch of beach extending from Nariman point to Worli is an absolute marvel. It's an ideal place to visit at night especially as it lights up during that time giving a view like a golden necklace. You can see People jogging, walking hand in hand, pedllers selling tea and refreshments all along the place. The best part is, you can sit for an eternity without anyone disturbing you. It get's a bit crowded at night times when there is a lot of hustle, bustle around the place. Some of the best cars and bikes can be see plying along the Marine Drive road. The sunrise from this place is an amazing view to watch. The nearest railway link is Marine Lines and Churchgate from where it's a 2 min walk. This stretch has some of the best hotels of Mumbai lined up. There is one Pizza parlor 'Pizza by the Bay', which serves delicious breakfast. The cool wind in your hair, the smell of seawater is all that is needed to refresh a person here. In short, an awesome place to visit in Mumbai."
Its beautiful! A curved stretch of coastline which lights up like a necklace at night giving it the name 'Queens Necklace' The Mumbai skyline can be seen. There is no beach but its wonderful to see the waves when the tide comes in. During the monsoon tall waves lash the wall. Lots of people can be seen jogging and walking along Marine Drive. It is one of the better looking parts of Mumbai.
Sat in the sun on Marine Drive and appreciated not being hassled by anyone. Then went and had a cup of tea at the Intercontinental Hotel followed by gins and tonics on the rooftop restaurant there while watching the sun go down on the Arabian Sea. A must do. Even if it is very pricey and the music is really irritating.
Marine Drive has amazing views all along the West of Mumbai. Beautiful to sit on the edge of the bay at sunset and watch the sun go down with a delicious breeze. Big enough to be lively but without feeling crowded.
"To say that this spot is one of the jewels of Mumbai won't be an exaggeration. Also referred to as the Queen's Necklace because if viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls,forming a necklace. The view of Arabian Sea and road side food along with adventure activities makes time fly when you visit Marine Drive. A must visit place in Mumbai."
"Probably my personal best place to visit in Mumbai in all times.Do jogging or exercise in the morning , have a late afternoon walk and feel the cool breeze in the evening or just drive by...it is the best.......and have a some great food nearby.......best place to chill out"
xecellent place to b in at any time of the year ..nite u can c whole of mumbai there sitting and njoying family get together..view of queens necklace at nite is breathtaking..lovely place fr relaxing and c the world go by
"its facing Arabian sea, it starts from NTPC... near Air India building / Oberoi five star hotel, nearest railway station is ""chruchgate"". Its nice place to visit during morning and evening time. It runs upto ""chowpati"". In the evening when the lights are lit, from top of a tall building it looks like a necklane of a Queen...Hence named Queen's necklace, its the posh locality of the city."
"In the night the Marine Drive looks like a lighted necklace. One can take a leisurely walk along the drive. The light breeze, the roar of the ocean and the ""time pass"" (peanuts), does anyone ever want anything more?"
"the seaside is calm, the street on the other side is very noisy in a drive like this anywhere in the World there should be like ice cream stall or what ever food or drink stand here nothing at all, dark, boring, and smelly specially when the sea is down we walked like an hour at night to approach a nicely illuminated building which happened to be not a momunment but a hospital It looked though local are enjoying it very much"
"my favorite place in south Bombay. It's beautiful in the night. You will see why it's called ""Queen's necklace"". There are many restaurants around as well. Good place to go chill."
"Queen's Necklace ! the most panoramic place in whole of Mumbai, where one can see the vastness of the Arabian sea and watch the beautiful sunset"
"Very nice place to visit! The view of the city and the sea that you get from this place is beyond words. At night, the place looks even more beautiful. If you love photography, bring your camera and catch some amazing snaps of the city. A must-visit place in Mumbai."
It is a good place to visit. It is very peaceful. The scenery is very good . I liked it.
"Pretty at night but, with all the other lights it kind of blends in."
This where you would see most the upper Mumbai wallahs unwinding in evening and taking walks in the morning.
"a very scenic place......... sea surrounded by tall buildings. In the morning, some people would be seen jogging around... and some would be simply enjoying the sunrise....., in the evening, it is all lightened up and looks like a party place. happening- all round the year"
"You need to note, it's an open space to sit and enjoy, and police font allow you sit after 10pm. So you can visit within that. It's almost 9kms long, you can go for morning jog or evening walk. On weekdays, if all buildings on opposite have lights on, the view is mesmerizing. You cannot touch or go near water. There is a ramp, there you can sit and enjoy some snacks and view."
"Marine Drive is a long Promenade in Mumbai alongside a wide road. It spreads form Girgaon Chowpatty to Nariman Point. It is also famously known as the Queen's Necklace due to its beautiful night view under elimination. It is one of the most popular tourist spots as well as hang out place for the locals, several people can be spotted doing their morning and evening walk through the promenade. The place looks attractive and crowded especially in the evening / night, when one can sit and relax or take a leisurely stroll through the promenade under the cool breeze. Several restaurants and local fast foods are also located in the stretch of the road. An ideal place for relaxation with family and friends."
"Queen's necklace is such a peaceful and calm place to visit. You can spend hours here without even realising. It is an open space facing the ocean. Is it absolutely free and open 24/7 for the public. Street vendors keep on coming at different time intervals to offer tea, coffee, milk, snacks etc. Even at 4am this place is never empty. There are always people here either enjoying the view or exercising. Must visit place when in Mumbai."
Rightly mentioned !! What an absolute pleasure to eyes! Can sit there for hours and experience the beautiful view
"Heart of mumbai , a must visit place to hang out , beautiful walks , lovely view and for refreshing yourself ."
A view worth going.Sit here in evening any enjoy the european vibes of india.A few good and costly restraunts are nearby from their you can enjoy the view too.
In fast moving city line mumbai its important to seat back and relax and get rid of all negative vibes. Marines is a perfect place to find peace . You can visit with family and friends and have a great time . Its near marine lines railway station. You can also go by grant road railway station . Nearby churchgate area provides you with wide range cuisine shopping. In dark the queen necklace is really adorable.
"Marine Drive is the best! Well what can I say more ? During my 7 year stay in Mumbai from 2015-2022 I had the wonderful opportunity to visit this iconic promenade every working day as my office was located in Air India building. Every day post lunch I would go for a stroll with colleagues even when it was hot. Evenings were perfect for sunsets, monsoons were the time for high tides. Sunday mornings were ideal to observe youngsters and the old jogging, people doing yoga and exercises, super bikes racing past. During monsoons couples sitting under an umbrella were the frequent sights. The ice creams at Rustom, snacks at the tapri near air india building, pav bhaji at Girgaum chowpatty and the holidays during Ganesh Visarjan, New Year’s Eve, Christmas, National Holidays and the unscheduled stayback at office especially during heavy monsoons when trains were shut all remind me so much of this iconic place, bringing back memories of a lifetime. My favourite place in the whole of Mumbai!"
"Your Mumbai trip is incomplete without visiting this place. Be it day or night, this place has its own unique experience. The view is unlike any other, it's resembles like pearls on a necklace, when seen from an elevated place. But on Hygiene front, they can improve."
"Had been to this famous promenade in South Mumbai a few weeks ago. It is visited by locals and foreign tourists. Earlier known as Kennedy Sea Face in 1915 during the British era, this promenade stretches from Malabar Hill to Nariman Point. Overlooking the Arabian Sea, it is shaped like a banana and is 3.6 kms long. Also known as Queen's Necklace, this promenade is best visited during the evening hours. One can walk, jog, relax and view the sunset & skyline. Avoid the afternoon hours. It is well illuminated in the night due to the street lights and gets crowded by young couples. Had strolled along the promenade and witnessed the Arabian Sea & skyline. This promenade is an ideal place for families, couples as well as young students. It is a must visit and should not be missed."
"This place is good to sit, relax and enjoy the winds coming from sea and to reach here, either you need to walk a lot or should have private vehicle ."
"I am a fan of Bollywood movies. I have seen Marine Drive in so many bollywood movies filmed in Mumbai. And I always had a wish to visit here. And finally after years and years of my patience I got chance to visit India. I really love Marine Drive. But the policemen did not let me sit there for late night. I don't know why they've those strict regulations but had to follow the cops, right?"
Passed by Marine Drive as we entered Mumbai via the new bridge and proceeded towards our destination. Lovely as always!
"Nice place to chill with the locals, take a walk and enjoy the views. Apparently, Sunday morning is a good time to go, if you want to see 'local activity' like people practising yoga or something. We went on a Saturday morning when it wasn't too busy. I am guessing it is packed in the evening."
"Lovely walk, very atmospheric and a great place to people watch. We were asked for lots of pictures and appeared in many cleverly angled selfies but that’s India (and indeed Asia) for you."
"Excellent opinion! I like this city. Everything is absolutely safe and friendly! Perfect restaurants, hotels etc."
Catch it going north so you are closer to the water and try to have binoculars. Rush hours are best so you can take pictures.
Nice place to spend your evening with your close ones. Been here couple of time during my stay in Mumbai. One side you see the Seaside and busy traffic on the other
Marine drive is alled as queens necklace and it's located in South Mumbai area and I totally loved the vibes there
Gorgeous to sit thru the sunset and then see the entire Mumbai skyline lot in front of you inch by inch... very safe place with enough police roaming around. Must do
"We stayed at the intercontinental and the views of Marine Drive were wonderful - early morning walkers, families during the day and couples jostling for seats at sunset and well into the night. And it really does look like it’s nickname, the Queens necklace, when it’s all lit up at night. Beautiful."
"Beautiful, calm and a stunning view of the sea and the Mumbai skyline. Couples sitting all along the wall as well as people napping"
I would recommend visiting this place just before midnight. Warm tea with the midnight stars and street lights hit u in a different way. Bring out the love for mumbai
Also known as Queens Necklace in the night for a beautiful drive along the sea although high traffic conjunction during office hours
"It’s a great place to sit around and watch the sunset. It’s lively to see so many people around. You will find people jogging, friends chit chatting, families spending time together, children playing. Mumbai police keeps patrolling so is safe."
Mariane drive is famous for the necklace becoz it's so beautiful in night it appears to be like a necklace from the proper view.the place which never sleeps and best place to hangout
"An approximately 5 km walkway an the shore of the Arabian Sea, overlooking parts of northern Mumbay. A lovely place to start or and your day. Don’t miss it!"
Went here around 6.30 and found a place to sit on the ledge. We got a very beautiful view of the sunset and had a very relaxing time here.
its a fabulous place to sit and relax and watch the waves. At night you can see the queens necklace from this place.
"Everyone goes here, it is one of the nicer places in Mumbai, it was very very busy, a bit noisy but obviously a place people go to be seen and lovers go to sit and gaze out to sea."
Visit the place in the evening. The sea view is best and most clean. Enjoy the scenery with Bhelpuri and similar things .
Mumbai Marine drive was well worth the wait via toll and travel waiting due to traffic. Please have money ready for the toll road is my advice.
My family and my brother’s family visited the Marine Drive in the month of Dec...the best time to visit this place is either early morning or late evening. We had visited it during late night and it had a stunning view...no wonder it is also know as the queen’s necklace because of the streetlights in a semi circle fashion...the only downside is that there is no parking place to park you mr car and enjoy a leisure walk
"Marine Drive also know as Queen's Necklace, also known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Roadis a three kilometer sea-facing promenade that starts at Nariman Point and goes on to Babulnath"
Something for everyone through the year. Sundays are specially so. Runners preparing enthusiastically for Mumbai marathon. Children roller skating and bicycling. Whole families picknicking. Man on monocycle. Dogs chasing balls. Gentle winter breeze. If you can see the tall flag mast of Raj Bhavan across the waters then you know it's a pretty clear day!
A best place to unwind and relax. spectacular during nights as it is called as queens necklace. The best way to enjoy is by walk as much as you can.
Make sure that someone else is driving. You won't want to miss the stunning views of the bay and the city. Or you can leave your vehicle behind and enjoy a leisurely jog or a stroll along the broad sidewalk.
"Mumbai's marine drive, the iconic marine drive. Seen in the backdrop of multiple movies, this walkway is a must visit for anyone visiting Mumbai."
"If you want to sit and relax, enjoy the sea and breeze, then Marine Drive is the best place. The sunset from here is amazing."
The place is a beautiful site for travelers as it runs along the shore of the Arabian sea. This is of maximum beauty at night as the street light give it a shape of a shimmering necklace.
Watching the sunset from Marine Drive is one of the best memories I take with me from Mumbai. Simply stunning.
"Marine drive is a must visit while coming to mumbai and one can sit back and relax.... Especially during the evenings, you will witness lot of ppl jogging, sitting, chit chatting etc. Overall a great place...."
"We were strolling around this place, and then sat at the sitting area. A colllege group came and asked us for a small chipping/ shoot for shunning the patriarchal mindset that boys don't cry. we enjoyed the shoot, this was a kinda different experience. Last year we saw a dance shooting. Hang out there ..no one knows what surprise awaits..."
Seen on my tour with Magical Mumbai Tours. An amazing way to see the skyline - incredible panoramic views. Wish I could go back around sunset.
After a tiresome morning in gateway and Elephanta one does require a rest. But after that you can head to the Marine drive. It was nice to sit near the beach ( no waves as its backwaters). Kids can play in sand and you can try the variety of fast foods available in the end of the Marine drive.
Since whenever I get bored or depressed I decide to visit here and of you are planning to come here than must visit here at evening. I always come here at evening and I sit here for long time alone and all the tensions and depression I loose. And it has a good jogging track about 4-5km.
"A nice view of mumbai skyline, neatly maintained and good for morning jog or even just to spend some quiet time here"
"i went there with my girlfriend ...its was really awesome.there are sooo many stalls,juice shops,snack shops . this place is best for morning walk and evening walk. the beach was little dirty and smelly .....but the overall ambience and experience was awesome......{ Tips for couples-better to take an umberlla }"
"It’s a nice corniche, with lovely views of the city and the Arabian Sea. Given how hot it is in Mumbai, it would be nice it there were more shade trees along the way. Also, there are not really places to stop and grab a drink right along the way."
We done this walk at sunset and it was excellent. The sun set is brilliant and it’s a very nice walk with the Mumbai sky line in view. Would recommend doing this if you are in Mumbai. But start north and work down south for the best views of the sunset
it is best place to go for fresh wind and nice walk. i went with my family we all enjoyed. beautiful beach
This place is amazing in evening and night. Good for friends and family. Few good restaurants nearby. Can gonalone for peace of mind.
It is simply awesome. The best place in Mumbai to hangout. Cool breeze blowing and awesome atmosphere around makes it even more special. A must visit place when in Mumbai.
Beautiful view all around this drive with Armenian sea at one side and beautiful heritage structures on other side.A clean beach maintained by corporation and Paradise for walkers.My favourite place always.
"Best place for chilling with friends..located in South Mumbai also known as queens necklace, because at night the bright yellow lights looks like the golden neckless.."
"Everyone should visit this place if you have been to mumbai. Its very nice place, one can get cool breeze."
The night view of marine drive after a shower for a late night drive is a thrill by itself. The glittering roads with reflection all through will give a boost to your romantic mood.
the Marine drive or queens neckalace as it is also known is a nice well maintained place to visit . Thoughh could have been better but is still well maintained and a must see for all people coming to Mumbai
"Best sight seeing destinations in Mumbai, No matter you are of which age group. Very romantic & joyful time spending experience."
"This is one of the best sea facing walkable stretch, lots of fresh ocean breeze just makes your day, very refreshing to be here at any time of the day"
"An extremely beautigul sea face which is also known as wueens necklace for its curved road and the lights in the evenings which forms the shape of a necklace. Lovely place in the evenings to face the sea or spend some time cooling off. Opposite are some tall to medium height towers which has some eating joints but are costly. No hawkers zone but is a crowded place every evening. Great for health freaks who enjoy jogging and exercise in the morning. Reachable by public transport and has bus stops like nariman point, charni road, churchgate etc.Amazing place, must spend time here."
The best place to hangout with friends and family .You can come and see the beautiful sunset of here.mostly people's come here at night because at n night this place looks so amazing
"You will see beautiful coastline of Arabian Sea , at night with street lights on it looks like queens necklace ."
"Amazing weather...amazing place to unwind all your stress...carefree people around...and above all, a feeling of drive into easeness... perfect place to have memories...n more than that...peaceful moments with loved ones...must place to visit in Mumbai..."
Marine Drive is a beautiful place in Mumbai. One can sit down and relax near the sea. The view of city skyline from Marine Drive is breathtaking. Enjoy the sound of water and wind in this place.This is also a good place to click photos.
"It will be treat to eyes , when you travel across Marine Drive especially in the late evening. Awesome drive to witness Queen Victoria's Necklace."
How can a drive in Mumbai be complete without a drive to Marine . The best part in Mumbai that I love is Marine drive
"It is a sea face but does not has a beach, it ie next to a road, it is also called queens necklace, cause it looks like a necklace from aerial view."
If you are visiting Mumbai then a visit to Marine Drive is a must. The sea and the waves are so relaxing and yet enticing. A stroll at night or late evening is oh so fun. The kids just loved walking on the stone parapet. The area is very clean. People are relaxed and friendly. Though I think you need to beware of pickpockets!
One must see and experience Marine Drive. Beautiful sea view and chilling place in mumbai. Spending evening is must.
"It is place where you can visit with your family as well as with your friends you can go over there for sight seeing as well as for excercises. Go there stay at marine drive for the whole night with your friends over there, the breeze will make you fall in love with it and if you will be going with your best friend's and family you can a create a wonderful memories over there for yourself??"
We walked to Marine drive to have a view of the sea and to feel its cool breezes. There is no access to the sea here but there is a sea wall that you can sit on. There is lots of traffic on Marine drive itself and my children delighted in seeing expensive cars driving by. I've been told it is popular with couples on weekends but we were there on a week day.
"This romantic place attracts Mumbaikars and tourist alike for decades. The night sight give the impression of necklace, so named after queen's necklace which is well justified."
"It's a nice place to see how people relax no matter day or night. Although the sea is not thst clean or blue, it is ok to spend there a couple of hours."
"It was raining day n night. Young netizens walking, jogging, chatting n singing in groups. Couples enjoying each others company in close proximity. Loan wolves staring blank at distant approaching waves or at black sky thickened with dense cloud. Late night chap left the pavement in favour of early morning health conscious jogging Tom."
Marine drive it's specially called Queen necklace lovely south Mumbai sea beach it was great weather .lovely place
"If you stay in Mumbai and you don't know the place where you will get peace and fresh vibes, nature to experience the moment of wavy water and to see a beautiful sunset in mumbai.... So you must visit Marine Drive, it is one of the best spot in mumbai, you can reach here through any Railway station between Marineline - Churchgate its all connected. Mumbaikar named it as a Marine Drive which is very famous all around world its lies in southern mumbai near coastal area, whole area is designed in C shape covering the Coastal sea there's a huge sitting area made of concrete, where you can sit lying your legs down, facing the sea enjoying the cool breeze makes you stay there for as long as you want, you can take a walk to explore all around marine drive ,you can find all rocks shaped as a Tetrapod (structure) down balance the waves of sea..... Its very wonderfull experience, whenever I visit here,I vanished all my stress before going back home"
Last 15 years I have gone to Juhu numerous times. I remember the first beach I saw in my life is Juhi beach so it has its own importance even though I have seen many in country and outside. It's not great beach as far as it's maintenance or beauty is concerned but it's one of the refreshing spot in the crowd capital of India. You can take a sigh of relief forgetting hustle bustle of Mumbai once their. There are numerous hotel along Juhu beach and I stayed in some like J W Marriott and Sun N Sand etc. The USP of all these hotels are the same location along Juhu beach. Mumbai visit without Juhu beach is incomplete.
Marine Drive is the beautiful place in Mumbai to chilled out and enjoy the time with friends and family. Every one should go there and take some fresh air.
A very iconic bridge availbale in Mumbai which is a symbol for Mumbai and also very provides good view.
This place very good and a must see for every visitor visiting mumbai as this gives a very good view.
Marine drive is a place which gets crowded during evening hours with couples. It can be easily reached by public transport. I clicked some good photos of Arabian sea from here.
It is the most renowned place to sit and chill in Mumbai. You can sit with your friends and hear the sound of the waves. You are not allowed to sit here from 3-4 at night.
"Marine Drive is a must visit not just for Non Mumbaikars but also for every Mumbaikar residing in the different and long , extended stretches of the city. As you sit on the shore, if facing the sea you can witness sunset and the beautiful hues that colour the sky each evening. You also get to see the finest buildings of South Mumbai alongside the long coast. Wait till sunset and witness the street lights adorn the entire stretch and then you will probably understand why it is also known as the queens necklace. And if you sit facing the road with the sea behind you, what you will witness is the rushing & honking of cars each wanting to drive faster than the other. You will also find people going for their daily walks and some jogging as well. It is the place that has a clear divide between chaos and peace with you in the centre with the option of choosing from both. There are also very few hawkers these days. Best time to visit is 6 pm onwards to visit the sunset or in the rains, with the waves splashing water all over the shore too. Especially in monsoon, If you are lucky, you may find a hawker selling fresh hot corn cobs."
This is a great way to end a hot day. The breeze coming off of the water is cooling and relaxing. Go before sunset so you can grab a place to sit on the wall. It fills up so go early and catch the beautiful views.
"If you wish to have blissful evenings with your family or your loved ones, head straight to Marine Drive during sunsets. While sitting on the promenade facing the sea, you will surely forget all your worries and look forward to the sight of the setting sun. Have spent hours over here, chatting with my wife about random stuff in our lives. You will surely have the best conversations here with your friend or lover."
"This place has a special corner in the heart of every Mumbaikar. It is a perfect way to escape the busy and hectic life of the city. Even in the middle of a huge crowd, you can feel one with the sea and one with yourself!"
Fun place to be with family and friends. Long walk way good exercise. Didn't find any mischief mongers
"Yes it’s a true Universal Spot...and is a very unique one in the sense that one side of it is a very busy heavy traffic road separated by a wide walkway cum footpath from a very Beutiful part of Sea. South of Bombay originating Near the Gateway Of India, the Marine Drive is a very Beutiful place to sit/ walk around or even Jog... and you can find people of all age groups doing so indifferent of each other. Morning and Sunset time are the best and during rain it is best for Couples.Peaceful morning, Bustling Sunset and a Glorious Necklace view in lights at Night with the Mumbai Skyscrapers standing tall and Handsome!"
It's actually a half kilometer road alongside the sea with rocks in the edges.the night atmosphere here is very beautiful with city view and lot of people usually hangout here.
"Marine Drive also known as the Queens necklace is definitely a must go zone if you are in Mumbai. The view of the sea along with corn or tea to relish your throat just adds up to the beauty of the place. Visit during the day may turn out hot and sweaty unless it's rainy. According to my experience, late night visit is really peaceful, calm and quiet. Since, the traffic and crowd is minimum at night so the place becomes more relaxing. Hope this help you all. Have fun!!!"
"I had been to marine drive with my family and 18 month old daughter. She was seeing water body for the first time and I must say my daughter loved it... She was not ready to get down the promenade and the best part was, it started raining. We all enjoyed a lot in rains and it was my daughter's best outdoor trip. It was super clean and hardly any hawkers to bother you. It is indeed the one of the best places we have in Mumbai."
"must visit place in Mumbai to enjoy sea view both in morning,evening or when its raining.just sit and enjoy sea."
"It is one of the most popular places in Mumbai to hang out or chill. The amazing sound of wave, chilling breeze and the crowd will make you day and you will love coming to this place again and again. Specially on weekends."
"A visit to Mumbai will be incomplete with going to Marine drive. We went in early evening to enjoy sunset and stayed till the magnificent lights came on. I wish the high pollution level is brought down so that we can enjoy looking endlessly at the sea, listen to the sound of the waves and enjoy the occasional splash of water."
"Words can't express the feeling of seeing it is reality. Such a big circle around the beach, proper cemented bench to sit on and so many people siting to have a view of sun set..........My surely first experience to see sun set with so many people together....Night view is even better, try to see it both time, in day as well as night."
"Marine drive is a famous spot along the coastline of Arabian Sea. Road is about 3 km long. It is one of the most famous spot in Mumbai, a great place to watch sunset. And it looks awesome when lit up and that's why it's called ""Queen's necklace"". The view is really stunning at night. The distance from Churchgate railway station to Marine Drive is 2.1km and it would take you about 10 minutes to reach by auto or car. If you decide to walk it would take you around 30-40 minutes to Marine Drive from the station."
Pleasant place to hang out and relax during sunset. Good place to see Mumbai life. Avoid going in the afternoon.
Its that place which fills you with positive energy. Just go observe sea waves listen to the nature & it's music.
I would definitely say that Marine Drive is one of the best attraction of Mumbai. You just need to ensure that you visit this place at night after your dinner or even more late.
"Absolutely in love with this place. This place has my heart ??. I can literally sit at this place for an entire day or maybe longer solo as well as with friends and family, admiring the ocean and the sound of waves makes me connect to myself in this busy non-stop life of Mumbai. Evening is the best time to visit this place, and is always crowded during weekend's. Early morning you will see people from all walks of life having walks and jogging around. Sunsets are the best part of the place. The view is mesmerizing. During rainy the place has very high tides, but rain lovers can also enjoy it. A place where everyone and anyone can come and definitely are going to enjoy their time here."
Its beautiful place with awesome wether and climate....many people from many places come here.....it gives piece and just to relaxed its good
Wonderful way to spend morning and late evenings here looking out the sea. You can sit here undisturbed among the great masses of people. The promenade is beautiful. Walking along the path is truly a great experience.
"It was a childhood dream to come to mumbai ,and walk on marine drive. In movies we had see lots of time . ."
this is the famous beach and i really hadn't seen a beach before. So it gave me the ultimate feel of goa. although i didn;t went to any beach before this.
Beautiful views of Mumbai city can be seen from here. Nice place to spend time with your family in the evening. You can also take a evening walk on marine drive. Driving on marine drive is a great idea for the evening and making a great deal.
This is my favorite place in town. No bollywoon movie based on mumbai is complete without a scene here.
This is one of the tourist point in Mumbai amazing view walk as much you can. Marine drive is the heart of Mumbai for me safe place but be sure to cross road safely if crossing required as people drive fast there. enjoy view and cool breeze. If really want to enjoy Marine drive go in the evening it looks amazing once lights are on and weather gets cool too. Also start from one end which at the opposite of Oberoi hotel and complete as much you can ;-)
"marine drive does appear enticing, but it is too crowded all the time and you cannot actually enjoy an early morning walk or leisure time in the evening. there are better places in mumbai than this."
"you can walk along with sea side, cool breeze, in rainy days, big splash of sea water comes, worth walking and jogging on marine drive,"
"Best place to walk in Mumbai, best place to see the sun set and then head of to a nearby bar for a sundowner! Large pavements, so walking is hassle free even on Sundays when a lot of people come out to catch the breeze and sunsets."
"Beautiful scenic drive along the ocean. Quite few food options along the road, note mostly veg options. There is a huge sandy patch where the locals hang out and picnic. Good experience of the local culture. We travelled with the yellow&black taxis they are easy to find."
The best place to visit in Mumbai. The most beautiful part of the Mumbai city and also knows as the queens necklace and it one can the best life of Mumbai city here. With lots of lights and the sound area of the beach and an amazing sunset and the city of dreams is beautiful is the best in its own ways.
ELLORA CAVES
"What an incredible experience standing at the base of Kailash temple (Cave 16) and seeing that the whole thing , 33 meters tall, in front of you is a monolith, i.e. carved out of a single rock hill! This is definitely the highlight of Ellora caves! We added Aurangabad on our Bangalore - Himachal driving trip to be able to see Ajanta & Ellora caves and these were far ahead of our expectations. Each of these caves tell a story which you can learn if you take an ASI approved guide with you. The guides here are expensive, paid Rs.2050/- plus tips, but this was the best thing that we did. Our guide, Hasan, was very knowledgeable and brought the history to life with his incredible knowledge and story telling. Few tips for first time visitors: 1. Grishneshwar Jyotirling temple is just a kilometre away from Ellora caves, in case if you want you can go there first thing in the morning and then come here. Plan to reach here in the morning, both to avoid crowds as well heat from the afternoon sun. We reached at 9:30am and that was about a good time to be there. Even in Feb the place was already quite warm & the afternoon sun very bright. Remember that these caves are closed on Tuesday, so plan accordingly. 2. Wear comfortable shoes and light clothes as you'll be walking a lot here. 3. There is ample parking available. 4. After you park, buy the tickets and walk to the starting point you'll be almost in front of Kailash temple. 5. You can visit the Buddhist caves after this and then come back to this point. For going to the Jain caves (Cave 32 was good) take the battery operated Golf cart as these are quite far. 6. Guides are available at the place where you buy the tickets. We didn't see many, so best is to reach in the morning before the crowds. 7. Do carry water bottle, you'll need it."
Approximately 40 minutes drive from Aurangabad and probably the main reason people go to Aurangabad is to visit the amazing Ellora caves. We started at cave 1 and progressed to the amazing cave 16. Beware of monkeys above as a large piece of rock fell on the walkway below near where we were walking. We spent most of our time at cave 16 before catching the golf buggy to the jain section of the caves. We didn't visit caves 17-29 as we had seen enough and it was already getting warm. I would suggest visiting as early as possible to avoid the heat. Amazing place to visit that I could only compare to Cambodias Ankor Wat.
"I made a Taxi-Tour with Abdul Wahid in December 2023. We started with a few days Sightseeing in Aurangabad (Bibi -KaMaqbara, Panchakki, Daulatabad Fort). After this we visited the Ajanta and Ellora-Caves. These ancient cave-monasteries are absolutly breathtaking with beautiful sculptures, paintings and architecture. Abdul is very reliable, helpful and perfect english speaking. If you are in the area of Aurangabad/Ellora Caves and you want to join the comfort of an excellent driver i can recommend Abdul very warmly. Abdul Wahid Contact Number: +918888251925 Email: sabdulwahid171@gmail.com"
I’d been to Ajanta the day before but these are much bigger. I was unaware that for 30rupees I could have hopped on and off the e transport all day so I ended up walking round the whole site and back to the entrance in the heat. Think they need more drinking water stations. Definitely worth a visit.
"This is a world heritage place and very famous group of caves located at a place called Ellora, approximately 30 kms from Aurangabad city. There are many caves found, however only 34 caves are open to public to visit. The entry fee is 40 INR for Indian adults. If you book tickets online it will cost 35 INR only. You need at least 3-4 hours to visit all the important caves. However if you are someone who has interest in archeological sites/heritage places, you need a full day to experience the beauty of the caves and its sculptures. Public bus service (city bus no. 42) is available that goes to Ellora. The whole series of caves are divided into 3 categories based on 2 religions. Hindu, Buddhism and Jainism. When you enter, you will find cave no. 16 (known as The Kailasha) which is best among all 34. I would suggest not to visit that first and rather go directly towards right side end. Visit from cave 1 and come towards cave 16. Spend some good amount of time in cave 16 to appreciate the art there. Have lunch and hire a e-rickshaw for 30 INR to visit cave 34-30 which are situated at a distance of 1.2 kms from cave 16 or main entrance. Once you are done with cave 34-30, come towards right side and visit from cave 29-17."
"Amazingly beautiful and packed. It takes forever if you want to see all the caves. The worst is that they don't all look the same so it's not like you can look at three and skip the others. Some are better of course but they all have something different to offer. The whole thing took me about 4h by foot (there's some sort of big golf cart that takes you back to the beginning from the left end around cave 30). I spent quite a lot of time at the main temple though. They only sell water around the main temple but I remember a bathroom on the left side, around cave 25 ish."
Excellent place. Indian historic place .All are very old sculptures. For Indian entry fees Rs40. For full view it will take 2 to 3 day's
"A noted UNESCO World Heritage site. Pros: 1. The sculptures in the caves are beyond expectations. 2. The top down method of cutting the hills and making such beautiful temples almost 1500 years back is just unbelievable. Cons. 1. It is spread across a huge landscape. At certain points the stairs are a bit difficult. My smartwatch clocked 13km from entrance to exit and covering cave 1 to cave 32. It took us 7 hours as we visited allthe caves. However, it can be done in 2 hours if you plan to visit only the famous caves. 2. There is provision for battery operated vehicles that will take you to selected pickup and dropoff points. Problem is that the tickets are available only near the entrance. Another problem is that it does not cover the entire region. If you plan to walk some part and take tickets later on when you feel tired, that is not feasible. Another problem is that you will have to wait in que for the tickets too."
If you are interested in sculptures then a visit to Ellora caves is a must. The Kailasa temple sculpture is really fascinating. Please note that the caves are closed for general public on Tuesday so plan your visit accordingly.
It's a marvel in itself. A day long walk around the caves was quite rewarding. Would suggest to visit early morning. It's closed on Tuesdays.
The Ellora caves are really beautiful. One must surely visit them. The Kailash temple is marvellous. It is carved from a single rock.The sculptures and stories carved on the Kailash temple can only be understood well with the help of a guide. The sculptures are intricate and mesmerising. One should surely seek the services of a good government approved guide. Mr Bharath Joshi showed us the caves. His mobile no. is +91 90968 87878. He is an excellent guide. He is knowledgeable and fascinating to listen to. He presents accurate fact based information. It is recommended to read the Wikipedia pages and the Amar Chitra Katha comics related to the caves. The electric buggy service to the Jain caves is also good and well priced. The recitation in the Buddhist caves should be experienced. It is very interesting. One can complete all the caves in 3 to 4 hours.
"Our journey to Ellora, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, by taxi from Aurangabad was about 1 hour. It took us around 3 hours to walk to all the 34 caves. We were amazed by the largest rock-cut monastery-temple cave complexes featuring 5 Jain, 12 Buddhist and 17 Hindu caves and artwork dating from 200BC. Kailasa (cave 16) was one of the most remarkable temple. This is a must visit place."
"Kailash was the highlight of this Ellora caves , amazing art , culture & history . My suggestion if you start in the morning then take the buggy & look those further caves before the rush moves towards those caves & buggy line gets too big . Then you can see the other caves from 1 to 21 with ease , carry your own water , refreshments , fruits but do not litter the place with scraps . its a must visit once in our life time. the sculpture , the paintings which ever are left is breathtaking"
"These caves were formed by Monks many centuries ago. They are large, magnificent caves filled with the most outstanding sculptures and paintings. Words cannot adequately describe the beauty of the marvellous artwork and sculpture which is to be seen in these wonderful caves. To have the opportunity to spend several days visiting these unique caves is an amazing privilege."
"These are a series of caves and temples , some bare and some with beautiful rock carvings. The most famous among these is the Kailash temple. This is a rock that was cut from topdown to carve out the temple. As you walk around the temple, you can almost imagine how majestic it would have looked aeons ago , lit by diyas , painting on walls, reverberating with sounds of Shlokas and Artis. We had decided to see all of the caves so we walked from one end of the caves starting with Buddhist art to the other end with Jain temples. We bought a small guidebook that described each cave. The book gave the layout (caves are numbered) of the land and we chalked out our starting and end points accordingly. Many people go directly to Kailash temple which is in the middle, and after that visit caves only to one side , thereby missing many more. Some of the Buddhist caves are bare praying rooms, some of them are beautifully carved, the pillars deserve special mention. The Jain temples are small and well preserved. They can be reached by Bus, in our case we walked to them. Most people do not visit them since you have to walk a bit, which is a shame because the temples have beautiful pillars and deities (Lord Mahavira and Parshavnath). There is a lot of climbing up and down the steps, so those with knee issues - watch out! Tons of monkeys too, take care of eatables that you are carrying. A hat will be useful accessory. Most of local tourists did not have their mask on - be careful. There is a restaurant outside the premises, and bunch of eateries a little farther. The area outside the premises is dirty, and unkempt. I decided to manage with fruits, carrying sandwiches from Hotel would not have been a bad idea though! Maharashtra government should pay more attention to Ajanta and Ellora caves reachability and surroundings. It fetches so much tourism for them. It is a World Heritage sire , I am sure there will be no dearth of funds."
"This is a stunning set of world heritage monuments with the centrepiece being the monolithic temple of Kanneshvara (more commonly called Kailasa). The site is around an hour’s drive from Aurangabad. For families with children and/or elderly or disabled persons, a wheelchair service can be requested at the entrance, but this will mainly help with access to the Kailasa temple (which is the easiest to access by foot in terms of distance) and the cave shrines surrounding it such as the Dashavatara temple and the buddhist sites, the Jaina shrines further out may be difficult to access for people who have no degree of mobility at all. In general prepare yourselves for a fair amount of walking around and some climbing, and it can get hot during the day (even in the monsoon). The Jaina caves further out are a fair distance away, and the options to access them are a bus service (which we heard is being phased out), an electric golf-cart service (our guide informed us that the issue with these is that they get discharged after a few trips thus are best used early in the day), or walking. We used the bus service. In general we would recommend starting early in the day, preferably a weekday to avoid the crowds, and lastly getting a guide to make navigating the site easier and moreover to obtain the historical information required to fully appreciate the structures at the site. We booked in advance the service of the guide Amod Basole (+919422210571) who was very well informed, and made the place’s history and architecture come alive for us and helped us navigate the site with ease, and we would highly recommend him. There are toilets at the entrance, and another set of toilets near the Jaina caves, the latter are less used and cleaner. In comparison to Ajanta, the Ellora caves make for more physically demanding a day, and we opted to finish Ellora on the first day and Ajanta on the second day. The Ellora site will take up at least 6 hours to see and enjoy properly, unless your sole intent is clicking a few photos and leaving."
"The caves are under an hour from Aurungabad and roads are fairly ok. The caves open at 6 and it is worth going when they open if you can, to beat the crowds. Ellora is considerably busier (crazy busy) than Ajanta. Cost of the entry ticket - Rs 600 for a foreign national and Rs 35 for Indians. You can buy the tickets online which is Rs 550 but if it is an international account after fees you will be paying more than Rs 600. It is totally worth paying the extra money if you plan to arrive late in the morning as it will be hectic. There will be big queues. Cameras are allowed. The entrance to the site is built in such a way that it takes you first to the Kailasa Temple (cave 16) with other caves on the left and right and some caves much further away. From the entrance to the last cave it is close to 1.5km and we did not want to walk and see all the other caves. The Kailasa Temple is it. The one to see and spend time in. It is out of this world and to imagine how they built it is awe inspiring. It would have been so colourful. Some of the remaining plaster can be seen. The temple has carvings and statues on the roof too and is worth going up to look down on it. After the Kailasa temple the other caves look boring in comparison. On the way out and outside many many shops selling various things including food and drink. When we visited it was hectic and very noisy in the Kailasa temple. For every person interested in architecture this is a must see. The visit was absolutely worth it despite it being a hot day and sweating buckets."
"I traveled with my teenage kids and 70+ parents.so all three generations were enthralled with the sheer magnificence of Ellora. We did the classic mistake of exhausting our self by visit to other attractions in Aurangabad (Daulatabad,Bibi ka makbra,Panchakki and Grigneshwar temple) before coming to Ellora,so we reached tired and hungry.Then we made another mistake of not carrying umbrella.So be prepared as it will take 3-4 hours to cover all caves.I feel one should not tag Ellora with any other attraction. Hire a guide It adds to your experience and will really help you understand the whole story behind this project. Straight away you will see the Kailash temple but leave it for later on,first go to Buddhist caves that is uphill and you need energy.The slope is gentle but with humid August sun it's tiring.Elderly people will need small rest after visit to every cave. The Kailash temple is magnificent,totally out of this world.Climb the hill next to it to view it from top before visiting the complex.The Ariel view is something to enjoy. For Jain caves you can buy separate ticket for golf carts.That itself is an experience .The ticket is two-way. Every Indian should visit Ellora caves and it's wonderful experience for kids to see history come alive."
"If you love history, architecture and ancient marvels, this is a must visit place. Beautiful place, well maintained, amazing designs. The Kailasa temple is one of its kind in the world, carved out of a huge rock from top to bottom without any modern tools. Awesome place to visit with friends / family."
"First salute to the artisans who have immaculately carved such a wonderful heritage. The Kailas temple should be amongst wonders of the world. Can't imagine that entire Hindu mythology is carved in stone in one structure. Ramayana, Mahabharat, Shiv Puran , Vishnu Purana and thousands of moortis of God's and Goddess' carved in stone. Each precise. Not one assymetrical. None defective. Mutilated, broken by Natural forces or sadistic humans, they are a heritage to visit and admire by all who can. The Buddhist caves, Hindu caves and Jain caves each a masterpiece. Carved from top to bottom out of one piece of rock, with primitive tools, the KAILAS TEMPLE is an astonishing piece of architecture. The conception, implementation of such a project could only be performed by a highly intelligent, evolved and dedicated group of individuals. Unknown in history."
"We visited Ellora caves on 29 Oct in our own car. The road from Aurangabad is good and it is situated at a distance of 30 km. We parked our car in a parking just opposite to the entrance to the caves. The entry ticket is Rs 40 per head less children below 15 years. Here you don’t have to walk too much from the entrance. The first cave which you hit is KailasaTemple (Cave 16) and it is just amazing and the one which consumes lot of time ( 45 mins). Now on its left you have 15 caves and rest caves are on its right side. It is recommended to see caves from 17 to 34 first before Sun reaches due west and the see caves 1 to 15 later on as you may still find some shade there. These caves are different from Ajanta not because of period of their construction but also theme as you will find lots of statues here rather than paintings. Also you will find caves dedicated to Hindu Gods, Buddha and Jainism. Here at most of the caves there is no requirement of removing shoes. The place is well maintained and managed. You can complete the trip in 3 to 4 hours. For caves dedicated to Jainism you can utilise the service of battery operated carts. We didn’t visit Jain Caves and it was warm and we felt tired with our small baby but we saw 29 caves. Cave 29 after Kailasa temple is the best. Don’t miss it. Overall a awe struck experience"
This group of caves was started in the 7th century and the Kailasa temple dedicated to Shiva is a marvel of engineering and craftsmanship with the stonecutters removing 3 million cubic feet of rock using a hammer and chisel. Beautiful and awe inspiring and difficult to believe it was even possible working from top to bottom and front to back. The near by Ajanta Caves are also amazing.
"Well worth a visit, particularly when combined with Ajanta. Though I liked those caves better, these have sever intact paintings with many more caves. They are some of the better caves in India. Allow two+ hours to visit."
"The caves were about an hour’s journey from our hotel. Ellora is an intricate series of caves that are spread over a relatively wide area - which are classified into three clusters such as Jain, Hindu, and Buddhist (we heard from our guide there were muslim temples nearby too, though they were not officially part of Ellora). Most of the architecture is still intact after many centuries, though many of the paintings within have deteriorated over time due to dwellers lighting fires within them in the past. If you have time, spend a whole day here to see all of the temples - even those that are incomplete are also worth a visit. We had a guide (Yunos) which was recommended by our driver. He was an absolutely charm who took us to practically all of the temples through a path less taken (eg thru the hills, climbing over rocks) which really enhanced the experience. We saw so many temples that day, yet Yunos was able to enthusiastically bring us through each temple and shared w us what all the statues and structures meant. The guide and the caves were the highlight of the trip. Our driver (Md Husain) who took us to the caves was also worth a mention. He did everything to make sure that our ride was comfortable, and also told us about local scams and the important caves to visit. If you’re looking to hire a reliable driver, you can reach out to him at his email at mdhusain5494@gmail.com or via whatsapp at +918855835494. He is usually very responsive. You can also engage Yunos or any other government guide through Husain."
"Had visited these ancient rock-cut cave temples in Ellora a long back ago. These caves are a popular tourist attraction and is visited by tourists. These cave temples are located around 30 kms from Aurangabad. It is consists of 34 cave temples belonging to Buddhism, Hindu and Jain religions. The main highlight is the Kailash temple which is built from one single rock. These cave temples were built between the 4th & 9th centuries. It is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are photographers as well as guide services. Also, there are few local vendors selling informative books, souvenirs etc. Wheelchair facility is available for senior citizens and physically handicapped. The entrance fees are Rs. 40 per Indian and Rs. 600 per foreigner. The best time to visit these cave temples is from November to March. It is closed on Tuesdays. These cave temples are an ideal place for families, history lovers, photographers as well as architecture buffs. It is a must visit and should not be missed when in Ellora."
"Ellora is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India. It is one of the largest rock-cut monastery-temple cave complexes in the world, featuring Jain, Buddhist and Hindu, monuments, and artwork, dating from the 600–1000 CE period. Great and must visit place"
"Kailash Temple Cave No. 16 and Buddhist Caves 10 & 12 were the best. Cleanliness, aesthetic landscape and amazing architectural/historical/archeological dimension are delightful. Please schedule 4-6 hours or more to benefit from the site. Jain Temples require more climbing. A cap, a guide book, prior study, water bottle, comfortable footwear and a torch are essential to explore the caves."
"About 30km out of Aurangabad, this sprawling complex of caves is too much to cover in one visit. Take plenty of water and snacks....the complex is very large. The first cave you see through the entrance gate is no.16, and it’s also perhaps the most impressive. You need to spend a couple of hours in here alone. We went to the left with an ambition to see the Jain caves. Tip: you have to drop down to a road at the base of the hill to get to them as the upper path is closed off after before you get to them. There are regular busses that take the lower road to the Jain ones from the entry gate area. On the right side of entry cave 16, the caves just keep going. We went as far as the 3-level ‘hostel’ cave. After that we we caved-out (we’ve seen a bunch of these in China previously too), so we quit for the day."
"Ellora caves is a great historical place near to aurangabad city. The number of caves on a hill shows the great artistic work. Some of the caves which I like are Kailash temple, Buddhist temple etc. Ellora caves is a must visit for every tourist who is going to Visit aurangabd place."
"Due to Independence Day Celebration in August we got free entry, they informed till 15 August 2022 entry fees is free. Ellora caves has been beautifully carved which depicts a blend of Jain, Hindu and Buddha mythologies. Ellora is being more visited due to its proximity to the main city of Aurangabad. It is a short distance from the city and the roads are good (unlike Ajanta). One of the must visits here is Cave number 16 which is also known as Kailasa temple. One must definitely take out some time specially to visit this cave. All the carvings have been done so skilfully depicting even the minutest of all details. We came here by autorickshaw in the morning. Mr. Jamil, the auto driver was very helpful. He offers trip to Ellora caves, Ellora temple (Grishneshwar), Daulatabad fort, Aurangzeb’s Tomb, Bibi ka Maqbara, Panchakki at reasonable price. Should you wish to contact Mr. Jamil Chacha (Auto), he is available at +919960030265. He will also provide pickup from hotel."
"The Kailash temple cave is the best of the lot (separate entrance fees apply). Absolutely amazing to think how this would have been carved from the top down... and the level of detail in the carvings is simply breath taking. Put aside a few hours to see all the caves, some deserve more time than others. Ellora is a comfortable drive from Aurangabad, and the Daulatabad Fort is an attraction on the way. There is a good restaurant just outside the caves for lunch or snacks."
"There a lots of caves to be explored each are divided into: Hindu, Buddha and Jain (Jain being the most far off for which you need to take a bus which runs inside the premises and it's chargeable which is a bare minimum amount). Do hire a guide if you really want to understand and experience why these caves were built and it's purpose. Guide Charges INR 600/- to show most important caves for Jain caves you need to pay extra as it requires bus travel."
"There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which are open to the public. Cave 16, known as the Kailasa temple, is a particularly notable cave temple in India as a result of its size, architecture and having been entirely carved out of a single rock. Very beautiful temple. It will take a full day to visit all caves."
"Ellora caves is at a distance of about 35 km from the Aurangabad city. It is a united world heritage site, and is one of the must visit places in India. It has caves which depict Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. The best place is Kailash Temple which took more than 200 years to construct. Still exploring the place and will share more picture."
"The Ellora Caves promise an exquisite experience with its beauty. With the first look, one falls in love with the magnificent carvings on the rocks telling the stories of a thousand years. The dedication of the people who made such an extraordinary monument is clearly evident. A must visit if one is in Aurangabad. There are plenty of resorts and hotels available nearby, so it is very easy to get a place to stay. Just a heads up, the place gets pretty busy during holidays so plan ahead and try to get in early."
"It is in Aurangabad district of Maharastra India near ancient daulatabad city. The place witnesses 34 caves which is related to Baudha, Hindu and Jain. When you start fro cave No. 1 it was residence of Bodh Monkes, After that Dyning Hall, Then Meditation Area etc. The main attraction is Kailash temple related to Hinduism where you can Get statues and areas of Shakti, Laxmi & Shiva. Since temple and statues are broken, No Puja or rituals being performed. The Jain temple and caves are some far from here where you can go by Bus or by foot. If you are visiting in rainy season, surrounding area is mesmerizing and full of Greenery and small fountains. In summer it's too hot. Oct to March is good time to visit. Beware of unauthorized person asking and claiming to deliver some more.. Enjoy.."
Remind us us the great artists who worked for 200 years to build these caves and temples inside. Most of the temples are mame by cutting stone from up side down and from outside to inside. Great cultural treasures.
"While the Ajanta caves are mostly about the paintings, the Ellora caves are about sculptures. The sculptures are awe inspiring. There are Hindu, Buddhist and Jain caves. The Kailasa cave which is at the entrance is the best cave for sculptures. Employ a guide so you can get to hear the historical significance of each cave. The street vendors can be quite aggressive. If your firm and say, ""no"", they go away. Go early in the day to avoid getting too hot."
"Beautiful place only if you appreciate the artistry. Guides are mostly unavailable, so I’d suggest you study these structures before visiting. Do not spend time and money on locals who pretend to be guides. This is very close (~500 meters) to Ghrishneshwar Jyotirling; so you may plan your itinerary accordingly. Electric carts are available for the Jain caves for a fare of 30 rupees. Top view of the Kailash temple should not be missed."
"Ellora, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is a set of 34 magnificent rock-cut cave temples. These enigmatic cave temples are dedicated to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism faiths and were constructed between 5th and 10th Century. The intricate carving of the temples is a spectacular architectural wonder. Cave 16, the Kailasa Mandir, houses the single largest monolithic excavation and is carved out of a single rock. Cave 10, the Vishvakarma cave houses a large statue of Buddha and several rock-cut idols. The ribbed rock ceiling has been carved like wooden beams, hence the cave is also popularly known as the “Carpenter’s Cave”. Ellora caves are about 30 km from Aurangabad and are easily accessible by road. It takes approximately two and a half hours to visit all the permitted caves. There are also battery operated buggies to transport tourists to the northern caves. Overall a day very well spent."
"Must visit for India travelers! This place leaves you mesmerized and speechless. Be ready to spend several hours here, as well as doing a lot of walking and climbing. December temps were perfect but still a bit humid after walking and climbing steps."
"Witness the breathtaking beauty of Ellora, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located 30km from Aurangabad. The site spans over 2 km and features 34 monasteries and temples carved into a high basalt cliff. Marvel at the uninterrupted sequence of monuments dating from A.D. 600 to 1000, showcasing the rich civilization of ancient India. You can explore sanctuaries dedicated to Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, highlighting the diverse religious heritage. It's a clean and serene environment, surrounded by stunning mountain gardens. Entry ticket is Rs. 40, book online to save ?5 compared to on-site purchases. Plan for a minimum of 3 hours for a comprehensive visit. Wear comfortable shoes suitable for extended walks. Electric vehicle transport is available inside at an extra cost. Drones are not allowed on the premises. Visit during the monsoon to witness beautiful waterfalls, adding an extra layer of enchantment."
Its unimaginable to think that humans have achieved this amazing feat of carving a mountain from top into a temple. That too with ramayan and mahabarat depicted in the carvings at few places. Its worth a visit. Its better not to take kids as they wont be able to appreciate it and there is quite a bit of walking to explore the caves.
"A place one should visit in a lifetime.We had been to this cave this month. It was a bit tiresome....but an astonishing experience that the cave was carved into such beautiful artistic sculptures belonging to Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism...excavated over a period of 600 years. Plan for at least two days to view all 34 caves satisfactorily"
"The historical site “ Ellora “ is not less then a Wonder in world .. it’s 8 th wonder that why it’s not in the list .. the carving in mountains near Aurangabad is beyond imagination, the statues are mostly destroyed by anti Hindu rulers of India .. three religions are distinctly seen Buddhism , Hinduism and Jainism.. inside manyn Shiva temple the deepest cave you can see cantilever’s of about 20 ft it’s surprising how’s it in place .. beyond imagination of carving out of one stone .."
"Kailash temple(cave no.16)-The cynosure of Ellora caves No wonder many believe it's a work of aliens. The whole temple complex as it was carved from top to bottom- imagine the planning, execution, geological knowledge and sculpting skill. Just a chisel and hammer, years of labour and tonnes of rocks removed to create the largest monolithic structure in the world. OMG...Kailash temple gave us a sleepless night. It needs to be seen, experienced and cherished with one's own eyes. Kailash temple does not qualify a place in seven wonders because it's much more. Water falls everywhere, the advantage of visiting at the end of monsoon. You will need one full day if you are a history buff. Mr. Hussein cab services did a good job taking us here. You may contact him in +91 88558 35494 or mdhusain5494@gmail.com"
Great day spent at Ellora caves. Truly spectacular - especially cave 16. ?? We hired a driver who took us from Aurangabad to Ellora and back (roughly 40 mins each way). I would highly recommend Husain. He was on time and a very good driver. He also highlighted points of interest in and around Aurangabad during the drive and gave us tips the most impressive caves at Ellora so that we maximised our time there. Contact him on +91 8855835494 or mdhusain5494@gmail.com.
"Yesterday we visited Ajanta, which I gave quite a tepid review. Today we drove from Aurangabad to Ellora, which is 28 km away from Aurangabad. Even as a very seasoned world traveler, this is one of my most beautiful experiences. I feel I could visit Ellora again. The caves, both the Buddhist and the Hindu caves were wonderful, and had beautiful carvings. Unfortunately we could not visit the Jain ones at this time. The Kailash temple is outstanding, carved directly out of the hard rock, and it can be well compared with Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The carvings, the views and the architecture, all were wonderful. It’s a MUST SEE ONCE IN LIFE place."
Stunning is the right word for describing Ellora Caves.The caves are must visit for every tourists.If your into history & art its a must must for them. Located very close to Daulatabad city the caves well connected with roads. The caves are well maintained & kept clean.The best attraction of Ellora is Kailasa Temple.The temple is grand & worthy of a trip any given day.Caves need full day to explore it fully. The best time visit caves are during winters as during summer can soar to 40+. I highly recommend the caves .Do take guides along with you to get better sense of the history.
It is very fantastic place for a visit. The caves are beautiful and well planned architecturally. It's a wonder how single rocks have been craved into such astonishingly beautiful and detailed temples. Must visit here with family and friends.
"Road from Aurangabad to Ellora (approx 30 km) is in perfect condition. Once you reach there, pay and park of MTDC available there. Guide to caves is better and govt recognized guides are available near to ticket window. Guide are quite expensive as they charge minimum Rs. 1800 which is a quite high for a common person. There are Hindu, Jain and Buddhist caves to visit. The prime is kailash cave which is in front of the gate from where you enter. This is a prime cave to see and take maximum time. One of the best carving and you can say engineering. Then with 10 to 15 min walk you can visit Buddhist cave and they provide bus service (rs. 20) to go to Jain caves. They both are worth visit. So over all 5 to 6 caves are to be visited and not all. If you are more interested then you can visit more but nothing to see much. Approx 120 to 150 minutes are required to see the caves."
"Such magnificent caves. Do visit ellora caves. Winter time are best for visiting.. and at Monday ellora caves are closed Don't book rented cabs. Take auto riksha, it will be 200% cheaper."
"Ellora is located 3 kms away from the city. Road is good & can reach without hassles. Choose MTDC parking for safety of vehicle. Entry is easy & need to buy ticket at counter. It has caves depicting Buddhism & Jainism but the most amazing one is Kailasa Temple, carved out in single piece in the hill. More than half day is required to explore this temple alone. Premises are well maintained & advise to carry water bottle along in case required."
"Simply amazing… The sculptures , the shiv temple , the caves and carvings. Everything about this place is mesmerising. The entire Ramayana and Mahabharata is depicted in form of sculptures. Beautiful vegetable paint paintings."
"Infact, I would personally rate Ellore caves to be better then Ajanta caves....because they were very close to city and were far less scatterted then Ajanta caves....even sculptures were more visible then what you see in Ajanta..!!"
"It is hard to get your head around this extraordinary place made through centuries of creation. But what made it a deep and rewarding visit was having as a guide Amod Basole. If you want to truly appreciate the place then I highly recommend you take along a guide, and Amod is unrivaled in his knowledge and an excellent communicator. You will miss so many hidden treasures otherwise."
"Ellora caves are about 30km from Aurangabad (one hour drive). We hired a government guide from the ticket counter as our taxi driver advised us to beware of touts. Even though the cost is Rs. 1800 for the govt guide, it's very much worth it!. Of the most importance are cave 16 (Kailasa) and cave 10 (Buddist cave). If anyone wants a ride from Aurangabad or Shirdi to visit Ajanta, Ellora or other places around Aurangabad, please contact Mr. Hussain +91-9923616671. Very professional and knowledgeable about the whole area and a very genuine person who took us around all places."
"Wow - what an incredible day as these caves are beautiful and splendid and so well worth a visit. Just half hour /40 mins drive from our hotel Rama Aurangabad. Such an amazing masterpiece of caves, what incredible talented Indian ancient craftsman. You will not be disappointed and our photos turned out splendid. All our international friends never knew such beauty and splendour exists in India."
"Ellora caves are our heritage. We can match it with our civilization which exists long long ago. You see the best carving out of single stone, this is not seen anywhere till now. Mesmerized and can't described it in words. Need more time to stay and learn the history here."
"Ellora, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is of 34 magnificent rock-cut cave temples and Its in three parts such as Jain, Hindu, and Buddhist .the best of them all is CAVE 16 and its in front of the entrance You see the best carving out of single stone. The electric buggy service to the Jain caves is just for 30 rs return. nothing to eat is available inside the premises. { better carry something with you or plenty of options outside ]"
"Location- Ellora is about an hour from Aurangabad. Takes about 2 to 3 hours to explore from.cave 1 to 30. Start with 1 to 15 which are caves starting with carving of Buddha and then gradually moves to Hindu gods mostly Shiva . Amazin g.carving of Shiva marriage to Parvati, natraj, Shiva killing a demon, ganesha, durga(very very rare to see a durga carving). Also remember this are age old caves and carved deep inside the rock where light was none or scarce, but still so very well carved. The last.cave 30 I.think has beautiful large carved sculptures.. There is a beautiful sculpture of brahma, vishnu and Shiva and one of Shiva and Parvati playing dice and u must notice the hand movement of Parvati. The caves are in 3 sections 1 to 12 or 14 is Buddhist, then Hindu, cave 16 is the kailasa temple ( what a wonder), cave 17 till.the end.moves between Hindu and jain. You also have a buggee which can take u to cave 30 or bring you back They charge inr 30 per person"
We went there alongwith family. It was a superb experience. Most exciting was these structures were took 200 years to build as per Aurangaba management. On a board it is mentioned that who and when these were build but they have not mentioned that who destroyed these structures.
Kailasha temple is one of those incredible things that human being had done ever. Incredible piece of engineering and craftsmanship to build this sculpture from top to bottom. The best time is to visit these caves is during monsoon.
"It is astonishing to see the level of perfection and scale of the stone cave ruins. It is not easy to imagine how long it took to build. It is a historical heritage site that impresses visitors so much. I arrived at 6:00 am by private taxi. The morning hours are less crowded and the cooler temperatures allow for a slower, more relaxed viewing of the site. The driver I used was friendly and sensibly priced. Contact details are provided for reference. Md. Hussain +91 9923616671 mdhussain5494@gmail.com"
"Took a short stop at Ellora.guides are available and they charge about 300/-. Since we didn't have time, we didn't take one. But without guide, one cannot relate its historical significance. Well maintained."
"World heritage site, Elloram caves consist of Hindu, Jain World Elloraddhist temples carved in hill. Most of the Buddhist caves are in great shape. Only 2 or 3 hindu temples are worth seeing rest of them are damaged. Same can be said for Jain temples. You need 3 to 4 hours to see all caves."
"Great day spent at Ellora caves. Truly spectacular - especially cave 16. Would highly recommended our driver who took us from Aurangabad to Ajanta and back (roughly 3 hours each way). Husain was on time, polite and a very good driver. Not only that but he highlighted points of interest in and around Aurangabad during the drive and gave us tips on the key things to see at Ellora caves. Contact him on +91 8855835494 or mdhusain5494@gmail.com."
Cave no 16 is nothing short of a marvel in stone.The Kailash Temple and it's sculpture leaves one spellbound.Really how they have carved such a Wonder from a single rock is a mystery.Though time is taking its toll still one can see a lot in the caves.well connected it offers a lot of scope for explorers.A must visit.
We visited there early morning as we went in summer. Be ready to walk a lot and carry a hat. Huge caves of historical importance but marred by the numerous aggressive hawkers who sell their stuffs. Be sujre to bargain as the price proposed are over the top
"An amazing and fascinating piece of India's history. Cannot fathom how it was built. Each and every stone carries a tons of history with it. Started with Kailasa Temple and spend more than 3 hours exploring this masterpiece. Buddhist Caves (12 and 11) are marvellous too. Visited Cave 14 (Ravan Ki Khai) Have to visit again to cover 70% of the Ellora Complex. As per my estimate, it takes 1 and half day to explore all the caves."
"A must visit World Heritage site. Without Kailash Shiva temple, Ellora is nothing!! Carved from a single rock top to bottom. Allow 2-3 hrs. with a good guide to enjoy 500 AD history in intricate carvings. Next Buddhist caves, seeing one is sufficient if visited Ajanta caves. Next one or two Jain temple caves are also worth a visit although not in best condition due to vandalism."
"Ellora is very well-preserved, even moreso than Ajanta. The site is massive and I made a mistake combining it with Aurangabad tour on the same day. I would say dedicate an entire day for Ellora, and maybe with a halfway stop at Daulatabad Fort if it's your thing. Cave 16 is without a doubt the most intricate, but I would say still make the time to visit the other caves. The Buddhist group of temples are especially well preserved with a lot of scuptures to offer! The Hindhu group of temples are relatively less well-kept, but Cave 29 in the Hindhu group, which you can visit after a small waterfall, is a must see. I didn't have the time to visit the Jain group of temples, so maybe you want to consider riding a buggy to reach the Jain temples and walk backwards towards the Hindhu and Budddhist groups."
"A hidden gem in India. A must for architecture and fine arts lovers. The kailas temple is a highlight. For those who are unfamiliar with Buddhist and Hindu legends and history, a good guide would enhance your visit immensely."
"Amazing & mesmerizing structures. Words are insufficient to express its grandeur, craftsmanship. Fit to be described as another wonder of this world. Caves contain Hindu, Buddhist & Jain temples, & I simply fail to understand how curving such structures was possible from a monolithic rock"
"Drop everything and see Ellora and particularly Kailash Temple if you have not already done so. It is one if the few places in the world I would go back to. The crowds can be overwhelming, so if you can get in early (6:30 AM) on a weekday, you will have a better experience. We went on a Sunday at 10:30 AM. There was a sea of humans; but even then, it was a true marvel."
Excellent place to visit. Ensure you don't plan your visit on Tuesdays as it is close on Tuesday. Try to reach as early as possible because it will take the entire day to cover all the caves and yes don't forget to take a guide along. Kailasa Temple is a breathtaking architectural monument.
"A fantastic place where Buddhism Hinduism and Jainism blends together.Marvellous carvings on stone that will keep you mesmerized with memories and an experience that’s hard to explain.A big Thank you to Guide Vivek for spending so much time and answering all my questions.An unforgettable day and after visiting Ellora and passing Daulatabad and reaching Taj Aurangabad after a tiring day made me feel I am visiting this place again after many centuries.Thank you to the Staff at Taj Aurangabad for making me feel like a queen!Will defineitly stay at your lovely hotel next time when visiting Ellora and Ajanta for a longer stay,to experience the warmeth of Taj hospitality."
"Mind blowing structure/ construction of Ellora Temple & caves. Any time can be compare with best of the World most visited Ancient Structure. But unfortunately, Ellora is very very underrated compare to Egyptian Pyramid or Acropolis or Great wall. Ellora Shiva Temple is the Engineering Marvel. A must see place"
Over 25 caves with statues and images of three related faiths. Cave 15 is allegedly the biggest monolith in the world. Quite spectacular. Easy to walk around although there is a golf cart on hand. Not as well organised as Ajunta in that no statues are lit.
"Elliot’s caves are very well maintained. I think to look at caves it will take 4 hours or so. First we went to Jain caves. You need to take a golf cart for it. Costs 30 per person but it is good. It takes you to caves and drops again near the exit gate. The Jain caves are very cool. They are clean and well lit. I am amazed by the thought which went into execution of it. No wonder it is a world heritage site. Rest of the caves are also good. You can carry your own water bottle. The drinking water is available near the exit gate and is very cool as well. No need to buy drinking water which the boys are trying to sell; anyway that water is local and not even branded. Good luck ..,"
"The Ellora caves are 1 hr drive from Aurangabad town. It is around 50 Km. There are 34 caves. The caves are from 3 religions Buddhists, Hindi and Jain. the cave numbers from 1 to 16 are of Buddhists, 17 to 27 are Hindu and rest are Jain. To see the Jain caves one has to take a short bus ride. Cave no 28 is closed. The caves 16, 10 & 12 are most visited."
"Since we were time crunched, we could only explore 1 cave - Kailash cave. Do take the service of an authorized guide. Only then will you understand the minute details & beauty of the cave. If I describe the cave in one word - Outstanding! So well done & what a beautiful way in depicting the story & history. Do purchase tickets online. Budget for a minimum of half day to explore the caves well. Real UNESCO World Heritage sight."
"Ellora caves is a real wonderful place recognised rightly as world heritage site. Spread over a good distance, there are many caves. After taking entry ticket, one has to walk to see the place. We carried a bag with enough water bottles and cap during our visit. The main cave is a huge one and inside its pleasant and cold. One can sit and relax here. After the main cave, there are many more on the right side, aligned along the length one after another. One can skip a few caves which have many steps to climb. Main cave alongwith Caves 5, 10, 14 are particularly good."
In fairly poor condition due to weather wear. Most statues are partially worn out. Difficult to find statues in good condition. The Jain Temple is still in good condition and worth visiting.
"Ellora caves are a must do when visiting Aurangabad. Its a short distance from the city and the roads are good (unlike Ajanta). Like many have mentioned below, I too hired Md Hussain for this trip and it was a good experience. The guide (Mr Ali) was a patient man answering my numerous queries. While at Ellora, do not miss the Grishneshwar Jyotirlinga Temple which is next door. Should you wish to contact Hussain he is available at +919923616671, +918855835494. Email id : mdhusain5494@gmail.com"
"Very scenic and full of diverse history, these caves are definitely worth it. They’ll be more crowded than Ajanta since they’re closer to Aurangabad but Ellora caves are a must-see. If you need a kind and reliable driver, do reach out to Hussain: 9923616671 or 8855835494 mdhusain5494@gmail.com"
"As a child I had heard a lot about Ellora caves and so I decided that after visiting Ghrushneshwar Mahadev temple, I should visit here. My advise is that this is a great place to visit and you should plan it well. Keep at least four hours for this activity. Do some internet research before visiting. Wear light clothing and sneakers or loafers as you will have to walk a lot. A water bottle, sunglasses and cap are advisable. Most importantly do hire a guide."
Must see if visiting the area. The Caves are exquisitely carved and well maintained. Take a trained qualified guide one with a badge to show you the temples. The Kailash temple was stunning as is the Buddhist temple cave and the Jain temple caves and monasteries.
"If you are not a history, Art, culture lover, this place is not for you. Its an amazing place to witness the histical Marvel. One would not imagined what type of technic they have used for creating this marvel caves. Sp Kailash Temple. One has to visit this place understand this era from past."
"The caves were fascinating and spectacular. The Kailasha temple is incredible. It is important to have a guide but my experience with the local guide was not v good. They would ensure that the complete the whole visit in 1. 5 hiurs and leave u. Anyway, we enjoyed the visit. The sculptures are the highlight. A must must visit."
Its really an amazing place. One must never miss this place to visit once in his/her lifetime. One of the best temple architech in India. Other countries like Dubai has created so many things r showing to the world. But we have already readymade and so valuable things like Ajanta and ellora caves and temples but our govt is not popularising these ancinent temples which are our assets and telling us the hard work and talent stories of our forefathers. # Incredible India. I Love ?? India.
Heritage and truly historic. Nice place. Lot of walking is necessary so be prepared for heat / rains & managing accordingly. All in all a good experience and learning about our country's rich heritage and culture Ananth
Beautiful carved out Kailash Temple out of a monolithic stone. Took generations and multiple dynasties to complete. Very beautiful !! I wish they start a light and sound show to tell the stories behind it
"Lots to learn at this conglomerate of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Hire a good guide. Lots to walk.... be prepared. Worthy of visiting every cave. Kailasa temple is awesome, and is a real wonder."
If you have time pls spend one day in Ellora and a half day in Ajanta. If you don’t have time you can do both if you are ready to leave early and come back late. Ellora is open from 6am to 6pm. Ajanta from 09.00am to 5:30pm. So even I would prefer to go to Ellora later for better pictures because of the morning sun but time wise it has to be the other way around.
Great cultural & Architectural heritage. Especially Mahesh Temple. Carved from Top to Bottom. Dedicated to Lord Shiva. Other caves are good and dedicated to Lord Buddha & Hindu Gods. Separately 4 Jain caves dedicated to Lord Mahavir. Overall a great place to visit. Well maintained.
"It was really an impressive experience! Some of the caves are wonderfull and actually it is worth to visit both Elora and Ajanta caves, cause both are different and wonderfull. We stayed 3 nights in Aurangabad in the Family Inn Hotel. The Hotel manager is a realy nice guy, who informed uns about the possibilities we have to visit in and around Aurangabad. He also will manage them for you. But without pushing you. That is always important for us case we wanted to go by bus. At Elora we met a realy nice Tuktuk driver, who spoke with us and helped us to get the public bus back to Aurangabad. He gave us his card and saied to ""just in case you need a tuktuk or Taxi in Aurangabad"".(without pushing :-) ) And we take him! And it was a nice experients. He also brought us to the airport early in the morning. A quick but delicious Chai on the way and we arrived happy and without rush at the Airport! If you need a tuktuk (or a Taxi) in or around Aurangabad (Elora or Ajanta), call Irfan Shaikh (contact +91 9970928246) We realy recomand him! But back to Elora caves :-) A must go! It's really amazing!"
"It was relatively easy taking the public bus (MSRTC) to the caves and return back to Aurangabad. The bus to Ellora starts at the Aurangabad Central Bus Station located on Aurangabad Road just north of the Siddharth Garden and Zoo. There is no English signage at the bus station so you will need to ask employees there which is the correct bus to Ellora Caves. The bus drivers and bus conductors were helpful directing us to the correct bus. There is an on-board bus conductor for each bus whom collects the fares, you can confirm you are on the right bus with him. Fares are collected once the bus is on its way and price dependant on your destination. The fare was 32 rupees from the Central Bus station to Ellora Caves. The bus will stop opposite the road entrance to the caves. The return trip is the just the reverse, the bus back to Aurangabad will stop close to the road entrance to the caves going the opposite direction then when coming. Be sure to confirm with the conductor on the bus it is going to Aurangabad. The trip took about a little less than an hour. The buses are pretty rough, windows open and the road can be bumpy in places, not luxury but economical and a bit of an adventure. Don't know the bus schedule but they seem to run often."
"The Ellora Caves are a complex of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain rock-cut temples that date from the 6th century. Most of the temples are Hindu and Jain. The most outstanding of all the temples is the Kailasha temple, a chariot shaped temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. The size of Kailasha temple is just incredible considering that the temple is completely rock-cut megaith. The Ellora caves complex is a monument that’s truly worthy of its UNESCO designation."
"These so-called ""caves"" are magnificent sculptures carved into a mountain outside Aurangabad, India more than a thousand years ago. Calling this UNESCO World Heritage site ""caves"" is like calling the Sistine Chapel ""colored lime mortar."" The unknown sculptors who created the Kailasa, the wall carving of Shiva and his bride, and the Buddha in contemplation at Cave 10 needn't take a back seat to any other practictioner of the art, whether from Ancient Greece, the Italian Renaissance, or anyone else. But to visit them without the guidance of Amod Basole is to waste a great opportunity for knowledge and inspiration only the world's best professors can impart. His intelligence, scholarship, and enthusiasm for both his subject (principally the society and religious traditions imbued in the caves at Ellora and Ajanta) and for teaching make him a rare and invaluable talent indeed--certainly the best of the guides we encountered in India, and, as a teacher with a sharp eye for teaching talent, i have to add among the best instructors I've come across in any field. Spend 1-5 hours with him at either or both sites and you'll be much enriched for it."
"This is outside of the Golden Triangle, but a quick flight away and definitely a must see! I cannot emphasize enough the importance of having an exceptional guide as we were fortunate enough to happen upon (well, fortunate also to have our wonderful driver, Suresh Nikam--arranged through Incredible Real India Tours, who made sure we got our guide!). I highly recommend you contact Amod Basole @ basoleamod@gmail.com. HIs extensive knowledge of the Ellora and Ajanta caves is unsurpassed. That, coupled with his willingness to share as much as interests you, made this, by far, the most exceptional part of our trip. Should I have the good fortune to return to this wonderful country, I would request he be my exclusive guide throughout my travels."
"Amazing place to visit. An experience that cannot be described by words. Rather than repeating what is written across the web about Ellora caves, I'll just try to mention other details that I think can be of help to future visitors: 1. You can travel to and from these caves via MSRTC (State Transport) buses that run from the Aurangabad Central Bus Depot. The buses are frequent, average on convinience and economical taking around 30 minutes to reach to the caves (cost: ~INR 30 per person one way in Sept 2012). 2. Once you reach the entrance of the caves, you will find many rickshaw drivers claiming there's a walk of ~4 kms inside to reach the caves. This is not completely true - the farthest caves (the last caves) - the Jaina/ Jain caves may be far but the Kailasa cave is closest to the entrance (not at all a very long walk) 3. If you are someone with some interest in the history around these caves, Ellora will take up an entire day - it very certainly did for me. I know many who spare a couple of hours to visit the Ellora - they typically visit Kailas and a couple of other caves - if you intend to look at most of the caves, please keep more time for visiting Ellora. 4. There is a canteen inside the Ellora where you can get cooked Indian meals, tea, light snacks, juices, cold drinks. This canteen is located around Cave 15-16 (from what I remember). If you start visiting the caves from the Buddhist caves (From cave #1) you should reach the canteen nearly half way through your journey. The taste at the canteen is average, though but the option is much better than lugging around a lot of food through all the caves. 5. If you decide to visit most of the caves, there would be a lot to walk. 6. Flash photography is prohibited in Ajanta, but not Ellora. This may be evident to others but something that I did not know and as a result, I mistakenly avoided using flash for most of the Ellora caves as well. 7. The distance between the Hindu and Jain caves is probably 2-3 kms so you may prefer to take an auto-rickshaw or something similar to reach the Jain caves. 8. You can buy the official ASI guide books for Ajanta and Ellora from the booth where you purchase the entry ticket to the caves. I found the content of the books to be good (there could have been more details, though). Cost: Ajanta - INR 70. Ellora - INR 100."
"Must see Ellora and Ajanta caves near the city of Aurangabad before you die. These caves are unbelievably marvellous. Both these magnificent places are UNESCO world heritage sites. Ellora Caves (Hindu, Buddhist and Jain Caves) are around 35 kilometres (22 miles) from the city of Aurangabad, Maharashtra, in India. While Ajanta Caves (only Buddhists caves) are 102 kms (64 miles) from Aurangabad. Aurangabad is around 360 kms (223 miles) from Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra. The entire state of Maharashtra, including the city of Mumbai has lots of ancient caves. If you are a caves enthusiast, Maharashtra is the place for you as you will find several ancient caves excavations here. These caves were mainly ‘carved’ by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Ellora Caves: Ellora Caves have over 100 caves, but only 34 of them are open for public viewing. These consist of 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12), 17 Hindu (caves 13–29) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34). All of these were excavated by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains over a period of 600 years (between 600-1000 CE). Out of these 34 caves, cave no 16 (Kailasa Temple) is the most iconic one as it is the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world. How did those ancient people carve Kailasa Temple (Cave No 16) from a single (monolithic) hard, steel-like volcanic basalt rock and that too from the top? In just 19/20 years??? And all this, 1300 years ago??? Kailasa Temple (Cave No 16) flummoxes the minds of even modern-day architects, engineers and artists. To carve this cave No 16 (Kailasa Temple) from the top, it took 19-20 years. This means, around 2,50,000 tons of rock were chiselled out. This further means that on a daily basis, at least, 30 tons of rock had to be removed. This sounds almost impossible a human feat. Considering the time it took to finish this temple, it must've taken at least 8000 to 10,000 people to carve this temple. But how could such a small space accommodate these many people? Another flummoxing fact is that of the leftover stones. There is no sign of them in the vicinity or even hundreds of kilometres around the site. That's why most are forced to believe that this must've been done by aliens or with the help of superhuman powers. Maybe, sometime in the future, if any spacecraft finds basalt rock asteroids or meteors, then we will know who built this temple and caves. When it comes to sculpting, no doubt Michelangelo Buonarroti was a master sculptor and painter. But the sculptures of Ellora Caves are epic. According to me, Ellora and Ajanta Caves (2200 BC) should be on the top of the list of the wonders of the world. Nor the Pantheon, nor David, nor Sistine Chapel. If you haven’t seen the sculpting of Ellora Caves and the murals of Ajanta Caves (2 BCE), you have seen nothing. ? Don’t Miss: The carvings that depict Ramayan and Mahabharat on the ground floor on either side of Kailasa temple. If you carefully notice the walls of the carved hillside of the Kailasa Temple, you will see the chisel marks on the rocks. I was surprised to see one Kamasutra like carving on the upper floor of this temple. But this is not a Kamasutra temple. So do not rush to this temple to see Kamasutra carvings. For that you can visit Khajuraho and Konark and Modhera sun temples. Kailasa Temple has to be seen for the sheer scientific and artistic mastery of ancient Indians. This is Lord Shiva's temple. And maybe, since Lord Shiva is also known as Kamadeva (God of Love), explains the reason for this. Best View of Cave No 16: Hike up the hill on the right side of the Cave No 16 (Kailasa Temple) to get a bird’s eye view and a perspective of how the sculptors started carving this temple from the top of a single (monolithic) rock. Must See: Ellora caves number 16, 10, 11, 14, 29 and 32. If you visit during the monsoon (end of June to early September) you will get to see a beautiful waterfall at Cave No 29. This cave is the most spacious and airiest of all and it actually transports you back in time. A lot many people give it a skip as it requires some walking. But do not skip this one. To visit cave number 32 and 29, you will have to take a bus from a spot outside Cave No 16 (Kailasa Temple). The to-and-fro bus journey charges Rs. 20 per person. But one has to wait for at least 30 minutes for this bus. So, time your visits to other nearby caves accordingly or else you will have to wait 30 mins for the bus. The bus does not take you to Cave No 29 which is mid-way. So, while returning from Cave No 32, tell the bus driver that you want to see Cave No 29. He will drop you to the closest point so that you can walk a few hundred meters to reach cave no 29. If you can walk the total distance of around 2.5-3.0 kms to see caves No 32 and 29, you can skip the bus. What they do not tell you in the Notebooks: The awesome stone carvings of all theGods and Goddesses of Ellora caves were disfigured by the Islamist Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Since they could not dismantle these temples carved out of hard Basalt rocks, they disfigured all the carvings. It took them 3 years to do this. Just imagine, if Aurangzeb hadn’t done this, we would’ve got to see the most intricate stone carvings. What is more shocking is, despite this, city of Aurangabad city is named after Aurangzeb. Another thing which Ellora Caves made me realise is the fact that since ages India has been the most religiously secular and tolerant nations of all as it has people of every religious beliefs. The Hindu, Buddhists and Jain caves are proof etched in stone. Time Required: You will need a minimum of 4 hours and a maximum of 8 hours to see the Ellora caves. Must Carry: Carry enough water and dry snacks like sandwiches, etc., as once inside the caves, you will not get any food and water. Since these are caves, it will be good if you also carry a good torchlight. Clothing Tips: If visiting during extremely hot summers, wear comfortable cotton/linen clothes, cap, sunglasses, sunscreen, and wear very comfortable footwear as you have to walk a lot. One needs to remove footwear to see some caves, therefore, if you wear a cushioned, comfortable pair of chappals, it will save you the trouble of untying and tying shoelaces. If you intend to visit the nearby Grishneshwar temple which is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas (pillars of light actually created by Lord Shiva), avoid wearing short pants as you will have to be dressed appropriately in a full length trouser to visit this temple. Safety Tips: Since there are a lot of monkeys around the caves, be careful with your mobile phones and other belongings as they may snatch it from your hand. Though the monkeys seem to be well-behaved but avoid eating in front of them as they might snatch away your meal. Do not give mobile phones and wallets to kids as it is easy for monkeys to snatch it away from them. Toilet Facility: Toilets are just before the entrance of Cave No 16. The toilets are typical local government-managed ones. So, do not expect clean, hotel like toilets. Carry your own hand-sanitisers and toilet paper. Women are advised to spray sanitiser to disinfect the toilet seat before using them. Ticket Charges: Indian Adults are charged INR 40 rupees. Foreigners are charged INR 600 rupees. Days & Timings: Ellora Caves are closed on Tuesdays and are open from 9:00am to 5:30pm. Ajanta caves are closed on Mondays. So, if you are visiting Aurangabad for seeing Ellora and Ajanta caves, avoid visiting on Mondays and Tuesdays. Only 1000 visitors are allowed in a day. So, either purchase the tickets online or call up MTDC office to check the status of tickets. But chances are no one from MTDC will answer the call. Best Time to Visit: November end to Mid-February (Winters) July to September end (Monsoon) Avoid visiting between March to June end as it may get very hot, and the maximum temperature can shoot up to 42 degree Celsius / 107.6 Fahrenheit. Guides: Near the ticket counter, you will find a lot of young guides who will offer their services for as less as Rs 300. But they are just amateurs. You will find the professional guides inside Cave No 16 (Kailasa Temple) and they charge around Rs 1600-1800. But I did not find them great either. Every cave has a caretaker. You rather pay these caretakers a small amount and they will show you around in detail. It will help if you do some reading on your own about the caves. If at all you take a guide, clearly tell him that at the end of the tour you will pay him only if he sincerely explains you everything in detail. Accommodations: For those looking for 5/4 star hotels, you have a choice of Vivanta Aurangabad (Taj group of hotels), Rama International (ITC Group), The Fern, Lemon Tree, Ambassador Ajanta. For budget travellers, there are a lot of options like Oyo Rooms, Ginger hotel, Treebo and other local hotels. Cab Charges: The taxi charges from Aurangabad city to Ellora Caves along with 5 other local sightseeing places like Grishneshwar Jyotirlinga Temple, Bhadra Maruti Temple, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum, Bibi Ka Maqbara (low-budget replica of Taj Mahal), and Panchakki (Watermill) should cost you not more than INR 1800 rupees in an air-conditioned 4-seater sedans like Hyundai Accent, Maruti Dzire and Toyota Etios. If you want a bill for the cab, insist on it before booking and pay the full amount only when they give you a properly stamped and signed bill with GST number. We got cheated by a cab fleet owner named Pranit who owns clearcabsrental He promised us a proper bill but did not give us the bill and is avoiding our calls ever since. Beware, do not pay the whole fare before the trip. They will ask you to pay 50% of it in the name of refuelling, but do not ever pay them more than 50% before the trip is over. Request to Local Authorities: How I wish, the State Government of Maharashtra and MTDC had employed non-polluting electric autorickshaws/golf carts at Ellora Caves so that visitors can easily see all the caves. Walking in the harsh sun and for long distances is really tiring and makes the visitors skip some caves. I would like to request Maharashtra State Government, Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC), and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to deploy at least 4 air-conditioned buses (instead of the current single Non-AC one) so that people get some comfort and so that they do not have to wait for 30 minutes in the sun to visit caves No 32 and 29. Also please plant more trees and have park benches under them for people to rest. Even a big Air-Conditioned hall and cafeteria inside will provide respite from extremely hot weather. The toilets should also be rebuilt and should have good international airport like quality and maintenance. It is okay if you hike the visiting fees from Rs 40 to Rs 100 but do provide these facilities. Along with Ellora Caves which are around 35 kilometres from Aurangabad city, if you also plan to visit Ajanta Caves (which you must visit) which are 102 kilometres from Aurangabad, let me caution you: The road journey from Aurangabad to Ajanta Caves is a nightmare (as of February 2021) as the roads are in horrible state. So, if you are booking a cab from Aurangabad, insist upon a vehicle which is in good condition (comfortable seats and Air Conditioning) and has reliably good set of tyres. Due to bad roads, it will take you at least 3 hours to reach Ajanta Caves. I suggest you visit Ellora Caves and other local sightseeing first and on the next day visit Ajanta Caves. ?"
"This is the answer to a question i asked to myself while planning my trip. It is possible to visit ellora caves from jalgaon on a daily return bus trip. You may catch the 7a.m. Public Bus to aurangabad from the jalgaon bus station. In about 3,5 hours you will reach aurangabad (160 km far from jalgaon). You will then catch the next local bus to ellora, for a further 40 minutes ride. You will therefore be able to reach the caves about noon. Just allow for a 4 hour visit to this wonderful site and you may come back to aurangabad in time for the 5 p.m. Bus. You will be back in jalgaon after 8.30 pm. If you miss the last public transport there is a bus operated by the royal private company at 6 pm. Although ajanta is on the route between jalgaon and aurangabad it is not possible to visit both sites in one day. In fact the visit to ajanta requires at least two hours. A taxi may speed up your travel, but it will cost MIN 1500 RS."
"The Ellora caves are simply awe inspiring. Cave 16 takes the breath away and perhaps should be visited last as the others simply cannot match it. As indicated by others the caves are divided into Buddhist, Hindu and Jain. The cost is 10 rupees for Indian nationals and 250 rupees for foreigners over 15 years of age. Most of the caves are good and all have their unique beauty. Some are unfinished and these give a unique insight into the process of building the cave temples. I would strongly recommend visiting on a weekday to enjoy the caves in relative peace. A guide is a must (same goes for Ajanta). Although relatively expensive at 750 rupees, if you have jetted half way around the world and spent time and money getting there, surely this is a insignificant amount to pay! The guide brings the caves to life and gives a lot of background. You can also get the same info from a book but it is not the same! I would recommend that you take your time and spend most of the day here. We also visited the mini Taj (built in the 1600's) which was a nice 30 minutes interlude on the way back. We stayed at the Lemon Tree hotel in Aurangabad which we used as a base to spend a day at Ajanta, a day at Ellora (plus extras mentioned) and a day at Shirdi to see Shirdi Sai Baba's tomb. Ellora is only about 45 minutes drive from Aurangabad. One reason for not giving the caves 5 stars is because of the negelect shown by the State authorities in not providing decent facilities for tourists. These caves are one of the wonders of the world and if they were in any other country would have been preserved, cherished, marketed and treated with tremendous respect, care and attention. Thought would also have been given to providing decent facilities for visitors such as clean toilets, official souvenir shops and higher class eating places plus protection from hawkers who stalk you trying to sell their wares. However despite all this, these caves should not be missed!"
"If you go to India, you must visit Aurangabad. Both Ajanta and Ellora Caves are one of a kind experiences. Our guide in both was Amod Basole. He taught us about the culture, history, philosophy and art of India."
"What are the Ellora Caves? They are a group of 34 rock-hewn caves that were carved over a 500 year time span, from about 600AD to 1000AD. The caves are distinctly broken into three groups: Buddhist (1-12), Hindu (13-29), and Jain (30-34). Unlike Ajanta, the area isn’t on a vertical escarpment but rather a more gently sloped cliff that allows elaborate carvings of sculptures and living quarters. The caves are also quite spread out, covering a length of over two kilometers. Why are they so important? First, the area is a metaphor for religious tolerance in ancient India with major structures from Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism peacefully coexisting side by side. Second, the workmanship displayed here (especially the Kailasa Temple) is absolutely astounding; it is one of the few times in my years of travel that expectations have been resoundingly exceeded by what I saw before me. How do you get there? There are similar travel options to the Ajanta Caves with the exception that the Ellora Caves are a bit closer (30km v. over 100km): public transportation, private tour group, and private car. I chose the latter for a fairly reasonable price through Ashoka Travel (~1700R) with the bonus of visiting Daulatabad later in the afternoon. When you arrive on site things are fairly self-explanatory. What are your options for touring once you’ve arrived? Those not arriving with a tour guide or formal group can enlist the services of a guide one at the main office for less than 1000R; this was already arranged before I arrived. I found a guide to be very valuable; we started at cave 34 and went backwards, spending about 30 minutes at the Jain caves, maybe an hour at the Kailasa Temple, then another 30-45 minutes in the Buddhist section. After the formal tour I spent another hour or so exploring on my own. Overall I found the combination (guide + solo) to be ideal. How was the experience as a whole? Thumbs up. Aside from the human interactions I had while in India this was by far the most impressive experience during my ten days in the country. Even if you didn’t know a single thing about India’s history (much less Ellora’s) this would still be an impressive visit. By far the most astounding area was the Kailasa Temple, which took 150 years (!) to finish. A somewhat distant second were the group of Jain caves on the north end of the complex; they were smaller but the craftsmanship was just as impressive as anything else I saw while in the area. Being a little more removed from main drag they were also more peaceful. The only minor problem I saw with organization is that the paths to the caves wasn't sign-posted that well so be sure and bring a small map of the area so you can find your way around. I used Lonely Planet and had no issues. Tips: *There is a walking path around the top of Kailasa Temple that is accessed on either side of the cave. It takes about half an hour to walk around but you can get some excellent photo ops from the top. I saw hundreds of people below and maybe two others on top when I went. *There is quite a bit of distance to be covered here; consider renting an auto rickshaw to cover it. If you get the right driver you might even convince them to let you drive it! *Definitely stroll around after you’ve had your fill of Kailasa. Many of the caves aren’t on the average radar screen for tourists and some of my most memorable experiences were just wandering in somewhere and seeing where I could go. In particular, caves 11 (two stories) and 12 (three stories) are excellent options. *Bring a flashlight! There were multiple dark passages that I wish I could have accessed but didn’t do to lack of illumination. *As of this writing, the caves open ridiculously early (dawn, before 7:00 according to my guide) so this may be a case of the early bird gets the worm. I would imagine visiting here as the gates opened (ie as the sun rises and with no one around) would be amazing. *Similar to Ajanta, there was a bit of ebb-and-flow in all of the caves with the exception of Kailasa. If you have your heart set on visiting one but it’s packed with people return in about 15-20 minutes and it will likely be empty."
"This is a true wonder ! I have to agree with all the wonderful comments written in the other reviews ! Here are a few tips if you really want to fully appreciate your visit to the Ellora Caves 1) Do not start with site 16 , the Hindouist temple of Kaliasanatha , even though it is the closest to the gate ! If you first visit this site , you will be spoiled and all the other sites will look pale compared to this one ! 2) Go to your right in the direction of the Cantine and visit sites 1 to 15 first , they are easily walkable and do not require a vehicle to reach them 3) Pass in front of site 16 and go to your left to sites 31 to 34 . Take a touk touk to reach them if you did not come with your own driver and car . Those are the Jainist temples ; they are really nice and you have to visit the second floor which is more decorated than the first one ! 4) Come back to visit sites 29 and 30 . You may want to skip the other sites if you want to get to the main attraction :site 16 5) Visit and enjoy site 16 , the wonder !!! 6) Some may prefer to have their own guide but we found that a good reference book is enough to provide the necessary information and permit one to visit at its own pace ! We got a book from the World Heritage Series for 59 roupies the previous day at the Ajanta caves . If you cannot find this one , select one that has a description of each individual cave as you will not follow the numerical order to visit 7) Bring yourself some water as we did not see any water holes past the Cantine 8) Toilets are available at the left and the right ( at the cantine) of the entrance . Nothing after ! 9) There is a good restaurant right after the exit of the site , food is good and not expensive 10) We used the services of Classic Travels from the airport for an AC van (we were 4) and a driver . Their prices were 15% cheaper than the hotel . An AC taxi would have been cheaper and o.k. since Ellora is about 30 minutes from Aurangabad 11) If you plan to visit something else during the day ( like the fort) do it afterward ! A visit of the Ellora caves takes 3 to 4 hours and can be exhaustive if the weather is hot and humid Enjoy yourselves ! it is a wonderful visit !"
"The site didnt stood upto the standards of being a world heritage monument. The whole area inside the caves were foul smelling, suffocating with people urinating, spitting and puking here and there. Except for the sculpture nothing about the place is worth mentioning. Needs hard maintenance."
"The Ellora caves are the most beautiful of rock cut architecture and sculpture in this part of the world. The depict the coming together of 3 religions - budhism, jainism and hinduism, carrying surprisingly similar stories. Ofcourse the best and the most beautiful is the Kailash temple. A new visitors centre and interpretation centre is being developed. But this will take time to operationalize. Dont forget your camera and walking shoes. A bottle of water and a cap is a must at any time of the year. This is an all day event and Hotel Kailash is a great place to stay very close to the caves. The ellora caves will take you all day to see... actually 2 dedicated days will be great for the discerning traveller. However there are other very interesting sites in a 100 km radius including the Grishneshwar temple in the nearby village just 10 minutes by walk from the ellora caves. Also see Ajanta caves, pithalkhora, daulatabad fort and a plethora of other sites of heritage importance around. The best way to get around ofcourse is to organize a car from Aurangabad, the nearest city centre. Else you can hope on to one of the tourist buses or the numerous jeeps for a ride more easy on the wallet!!! But this one is a MUST SEE in India"
"We were on our following 2 days trip from Pune: Day 1: Jayakwadi Dam at Paithan, Daulatabad Fort at Aurangabad Day 2: Grishneshwar (Jyotirlinga) Temple, Ellora Cave & Ajanta Cave at Aurangabad Helpful Tips On Ellora Visit: 1. Weekly Off: Closed on Tuesday 2. Timings: 6 am to 6 pm 3. Entrance System Entry ticket: Rs.60/- per person. Maintain the ticket token with you till exit. If you lost it then Rs.100/- fine. Token is use to open the gate for entry & exit. Entry gate is in front of cave no. 16 which is named Kailash Temple. The most favorite cave of the Ellora lot. Visitors spend more time in this cave to see the unbelievable creation of Kailash temple from single rock carving from mountain top to bottom. The area between entry gate & cave no. 16 is well maintained by eye pleasing flower garden. It's photo is attached in this review. 4. Washroom Facility One near the ticket counter & one at the cave no 34 i.e. last cave. NB: Make use of washroom near ticket counter before you start your Ellora trip bcoz you will be busy seeing the cave numbers 1 to 34 for 3 to 4 hours or more. 5. Food Restaurant Only one ordinary MTDC canteen restaurant near to ticket counter. You should carry your own food, snacks & water if required to take care of your stomach's needs. No other restaurants inside the Ellora premises. Food centers are there outside the Ellora premises. 6. ST Bus Service Pick up & drop facility from inside of entry gate to Cave no. 34 & back. Bus service starts from 9 am onwards till 6 pm. Rs.20/- ticket per person. 7. On Cave No. 1 to 34 Facing cave no. 16, to your right are cave from 1 to 15 & to your left are cave no. 17 to 34. Cave no. 17 to 34 are better than cave no. 1 to 15. Waterfall at cave no. 25 during monsoon season makes it more beautiful. It's photo is attached in this review. The total caves area is clean & well maintained. 9. Free Parking Small parking place for 2 & 4 wheeler on the road opposite entry gate. During my visit I didn't find any one collecting parking fee. Also cars can be parked on the side of the road. 10. Best Season To Visit: Winter & Monsoon 11. Best Time To Visit If you want total peace of mind to visit this Ellora caves without any disturbance from visitors then visit at 6 am. There will be hardly any visitors at Ellora caves till 8.30 am. We visited Grishneshar temple from 6 am to 6.30 am. Then came to visit Ellora at 6.30 am & finished at 11.30 pm. First saw the Cave no. 16. Icing on cake no other visitors at all in this cave during our visit otherwise too much crowd in this cave after 9am till 6 pm. NB: There is way on outside on the right side of cave no. 16 to go on top to get amazing view of Kailash temple & scenery in front Then visited cave no. 17 to 34 & finally cave no. 15 to 1. Cave no. 16 is the biggest & next big is 25. 12. Hotels For Lodging Arrangement Hotels in the range starting from Rs.400 for double occupancy are there near to Grishneshwar temple. We spent one night at one of the hotel. 13. Nearby Sightseeing Places Distances from Ellora cave entry gate a) Grishneshwar Jyotirlinga temple at 1 km b) Daulatabad Fort at 12 km c) Mhaismal (small hill station) at 14 km d) Bibi Ka Maqbara at 28 km e) Aurangabad Caves at 30 km NB: Ajanta Caves is at 100 km At 12 pm we started from Ellora caves to Ajanta caves. Reached Ajanta View Point at 4 pm & completed Ajanta cave visit by 6 pm. The road condition of Ajanta is too pathetic. If road is good it will take 2 & half hours to 3 hours maximum. At Ellora & Ajanta the thought does come to mind as to how this much incredible unbelievable carving has been carried out in ancient times. It is a truly an Incredible Archeaological sight & a must place for visit."
Please note the caves are closed on all Tuesdays. We drove for 5 hours each way from Pune to find out the caves are closed. I wish someone had warned us that it would be closed!! I hear it's amazing so don't go on tuesday or you will be greatly disappointed!
"The Ellora Caves were the reason I came to Aurangabad and I was not disappointed. They are very impressive. The site consists of 34 caves of three different categories. There are the Buddhist Caves, the Hindu Caves, and the Jain Caves. The caves are artificial caves carved out of solid rock and adorned with various religious depictions. The three types of caves vary in the way they are adorned but all of them have an impressive scale about them. There are thousands of carvings and statues throughout the site of various gods, people, and animals. Each cave is covered in carvings from wall to wall and has been carved out with geometric precision. The caves are all cut into the same rock face but span the distance of about a mile. During the rainy season, a waterfall cascades over the escarpment. The most impressive cave is Cave 16. It was designed to recall Mount Kailash, the home of Lord Shiva, the Hindu god. It looks like a enormous, freestanding, multi-level temple complex, but the whole thing was carved out of one single rock as with the rest of the caves. The amount of stone removed to make the cave and temple structures rivals the pyramids of Mexico. In fact it took hundreds of years to remove all of the stone. About five stories of rock were removed to create a large temple complex surrounded by a U-shaped courtyard with many large statues. The courtyard is surrounded by a three stories of balconies. The temple itself is covered in hundreds of carvings of animals and gods. If you have time to only see one other cave, it should definitely be Cave 10. To see everything though you will need a few hours. There is a small restaurant on site which is cheap and pretty good. The service is very good as well. There are also decent bathrooms on site. The caves are closed on Mondays. It will take about 45 minutes to get to the Ellora Caves from Aurangabad."
"There are totally of 34 caves in Ellora. Parking is available with a fees and the parking spot is on the opposite side of the entrance to the Cave. You can book ticket through the ASI website or at the ticket counter by standing in a queue or by scanning a QR code present in front of the ticket counter. Before you enter through the gate please carry water as you would definitely need it in case you want to cover all the caves. If you purchase ticket through the ticket counter you will be given a chip which has to be used to enter and kept safely with you till you return to exit. As you enter and walk straight you will land up to Cave no 16, the biggest Cave and the most beautiful piece of architecture. Probably its the climax which you will encounter before you take on the journey to other caves. If you are walking I would request to start with Cave 1 and then go with the sequence. Cave 1-12 is dedicated to Lord Buddha, Cave 14- 29 decimated to Hinduism and the Cave 30 - 34 dedicated to Jainism. If you are fit and atheletic do cover all the caves by walking as you will also pass through one of the wonderful terrain where you will find a pond below and the roads turns beside the mountain wall. Its a magnificent spot for photography and enjoy the rugged nature. All the caves are accessible by foot. In case you have mobility challenges you can take the bus near Cave no 16 to 30-34. But I would surely recommend not to miss out on the trek from 16 to 30 on feet. If you have limited time then do visit, Cave 2, 5, 6, 10 ( must see), 11- 12( 3 Storied structure and is easily accessible), 14, 15( double storied, difficult to climb), 16( the best of the lot) 21, 25, 29 ( massive and has three entrants), 30-34( inter connected to each other). If you cannot find the interconnection ask the security guard who will direct you to the right stairs. Once you follow the path you will figure out the rest through your instincts Ellora is magnificent and if you love history and art you will easily take 6 hrs to complete it. For normal travellers you will take around 2-3 hrs in case you cover all the caves. A place to visit definitely in your lifetime"
"I visited it on 2nd july. We thought of going by government bus (known as ST buses locally) to ellora caves and daulatabad. That was on our agenda today. We also had two other travel options till morning. One was that the hotel (hotel holiday era) ,we stayed in, suggested a travel arrangement out of courtesy. That was like 1300 rupees for ellora and other places (check the photo attached). One auto guy told us that he would take us for the same trip for 500 rupees. Anyhow, we made up our mind to go by State Transport(ST) red colored normal bus only. Once we reached the central bus stand of aurangabad, we saw one ac bus with comfortable push back seats (MSRTC ac shivneri type). We decided we would go by that bus. They charged 350 per person. We went to the following places with the duration at each place mentioned in the brackets. 1. Bibi ka maqbara(9:15 to 10:00am) 2. Daulatabad fort(10:15 to 11:15am) 3. One shop selling Handloom Humroo(a local variety of cloth) clothes.(11:30 to 12noon) 4. Lunch (12:05 to 12:40pm) 5. Please note that the driver told us that the next stop was grishneshwar temple at which he would stop by for half an hour. But since we insisted that we would skip it and get down at ellora on the way so that we could spend extra time at ellora, he dropped us at ellora at 12:50pm. We were in ellora from 12:50pm to 4:10pm. In the meantime, the bus returned to ellora and waited for us till 4:10pm(Though the driver insisted that we should be back by 4pm, hr was generous and a little bit flexible about time). I would tell you what is nominal for a trip to bibi ka maqbara - daulatabad fort - grishneshwar temple - ellora caves with regard to the following. Cost: Cab:1300 Auto:500(which was offered to us but i don't know if this would be feasible) MSRTC AC shivneri bus : 350/person. Time: The time taken at each place varies with each individual. In my case, i am an avid history lover. My wife is an architect. So we meticulously spend as much time as possible at each place to indulge in an experience. So maybe ours would be on the upper side. Bibi ka maqbara:45 minutes Daulatabad fort: 2 hours (we were given 1 hour and we couldn't go upto the top of the fort. 2 hours is my reasonable guess.) Another thing is that going right upto the top of daulatabad fort would make you tired and you might not have the energy to do the walking at Ellora if both are on the agenda of the same day. Ellora caves: 3 hours 30 minutes. In that much time, we could finish going to all the 34 cave complexes. About Ellora caves: Of all the things, Ellora is the Jewel in the crown. There are Buddhist, Hindu and Jain caves (numbered in the same order). All are unique. Cave no. 16 is kailashnath temple. That's the first thing you would see as you get in. Turn left and it goes till cave 34. Caves 30-34 being jain caves and all others on the left being Hindu. Turn right from kailashnath temple and cave numbers descend till one. We finished cave 16 and went on till 34. From cave 34, buses ply which would drop you at the entrance gate or would go further till cave 12. From there, you can see Buddhist caves,best of all is the chaitya hall. In one word, Ellora is breathtaking. Things to remember. 1. You have to walk a lot. Google fit screenshot attached for the day. 2. Carry a lot of water. 3. Carry a good camera if you wanna take some photos. 4. Travel light. 5. At least visit cave 16- kailashnath temple, cave 12- 3 storeyed Buddhist monastery ( teen tal monastery), chaitya hall, jain caves (30 -34). 6. In jain caves, we found breathtaking paintings largely undisturbed!! But I let you to find it for yourselves! In the end, this was a wonderful day for us. With regard to the MSRTC Hop on Hop off bus, it was totally worth the money. As we went as a couple and didn't want to spend too much for a cab, we took this bus. We didn't regret our decision. The driver was very courteous. But the con is that you have to keep the countdown timer set at the back your brain at each place. If there are at least 3 or 4 people in your group, a cab for 1300 rupees would be good. I thought of writing this as when i thought of going to ellora, there was no elaborate review for looking upto. So i wanted to cover all the aspects i would expect in a review. Hope I have covered it all. Thank you. Keep traveling!"
"We took a decision to visit Ellora caves first -- one day earlier than we could do Ajanta. This was because the former ones are regarded as better-preserved, less tedious to go round and nearer to Aurangabad, the base city. Accordingly, on May 9, 2012, we engaged a non A/c taxi from our hotel in Aurangabad at 8:00 a.m. for a fare of Rs.1,200 up and down. (The rates were increased only since May 1, we were told.) We reached our destination in less than an hour, as the 30 km road was good. The Ellora caves present themes of three faiths – Hindu, Buddhist and Jain. The taxi dropped us at a well-tended park in front of Cave No.16, the famous Kailash cave. The car park was also close by. Tickets of Rs.10 per head (children below 15 are exempt) can be purchased nearby. There is no fee for still cameras or mobiles. A fee of Rs.25 is charged for video cameras. Guides are available but they are very expensive – about Rs.1000. Instead, guide books sold by hawkers (at a bargained price of Rs.50 per copy) are very useful. Visitors are advised to go through the books well in advance. The Ellora caves are open from dawn to dusk and closed on Tuesdays. Near the parking lot chilled mineral water bottles and branded potato chips (wafers) are available in plenty at reasonable prices. So there is no need to carry them from the hotel. There is a restaurant nearby but visitors do not go there in numbers – rightly so. The Kailash cave is magnificent, described as the most unique cave and the greatest monolithic structure of its kind in the world. It was chiseled out of solid mountain rock from the top downwards and one gets the impression that one is making a virtual visit of the sprawling mountain abode of Shiva of the Hindu pantheon. There are numerous towers, sub-shrines, vivid sculptures and open corridors. Access to the upper floors is also available. To move from one group of adjacent caves to another, we could take our car, and directions are clearly marked on the road. For those without cars, autorickshaws are available in plenty. Under shades of trees people sit down and relax for a while. Cave No.10, a Buddhist Chaitya (prayer) hall, should not be missed. The architecture of the roof displays attractive “ribs” as if it were the work of a carpenter. One should step inside, go interior to the left and chant a hymn. There is a pleasant echo. Cave 32 (Jain) has lovely bas reliefs. All the caves can be completed in two to three hours. A leisurely visit to the Ellora caves, a world heritage site, will certainly be gratifying to the lovers of heritage. – Subbaram Danda, Chennai, India."
"Ellora Caves are 30 KM away from Aurangabad railway station. We have to book a 6 seater vehicle to visit Ellora Caves. After taking Darshan of Grishneshwar Temple we move ahead to visit this place. At entry point of the Ellora Caves there is paperless token system you have to pay Rs 50/- per person. Total 34 caves are there. Last 4 caves can be visited by taking government bus service. At entry you will see Cave no. 16 named as Kailash temple which is center point. Most beautiful cave among the rest. 1-10 caves are Budhdhist Caves, 16 -30 are Hindu Caves and 31-34 are Jain Caves. It's good to have a guide to walk you through the caves. This place is under ASI so area is well maintained. Although proper boards and restrooms are not availble. If you explored Ellora Caves then no need to visit Ajanta Caves(my opinion). As we were in great hurry to catch our train, we missed the last 4 caves. Highly recommend this place to visit once in a lifetime. Tip: Ellora is closed on Tuesdays."
An amazing experience. The caves were out of this world amazing. i'd only give it a 9/10 because while we were eating lunch a monkey commited suicide by jumping off a building and landing on power transplant.
"These amazing caves total 34 in all. Make sure you bring plenty of drinking water. I saw all of the caves and my favourites were caves 16 and 32. Cave 16 is the largest and most impressive (aka Kailash Cave). This temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. I loved the life-size elephant sculptures. It is difficult to imagine how they carved the rock to the sheer size that it is. Most of the crowds hangout here. Not everyone will see all the caves. Pretty impressive considering it was carved out by hand. There are no audio guides. My suggestion is to read ahead of time what the caves signify or buy a local guide book from the vendors outside the gates. Each of these caves require you to remove your shoes prior to entering. Wear easy to remove shoes. I hired a driver for the day. It took almost an hour by car to reach the Caves from the centre of Aurangabad. As a solo female traveler, I felt safe at the Caves. Note they’re closed on Tuesdays. Good to get there before 10 am to avoid the crowds. You will reach the end of Cave 26 (I think) and can’t go further as there are fallen rocks on the path leading to the remaining caves. What you will need to do is go back towards the main area, and take a complimentary shuttle bus taking you to the remaining caves. Make sure it’s not the local red bus as there are 2 buses. You’ll be dropped off at the ‘T’ in the road where you will walk not more than 15 minutes to the top of the hill. By now, you may feel tired so just stick with Cave 32 as it’s the most interesting. There’s a restaurant and toilet near the main entrance. Walking to each Cave is relatively flat and is paved. There are several vendors and a couple of eateries located just outside the gates. This is also where you’ll find parking. 500 rupees entrance fee for foreigners. Best time to visit is from November to March when the temperature is cooler. If you have limited time and can’t decide to visit Ellora or Ajanta? Ellora is known for its architecture and also has the largest rock cut Cave #16 on the planet or Ajanta is known for mainly the ancient paintings on the walls, ceiling and pillars."
"I loved the place! There are 34 Caves and be prepared to walk. I started from Cave 1 and walked my way until 34. It took me 5 hours and I did not spend that much time in all the caves. If I would repeat the trip, I would start from Cave 16, definatelly the most amazing one, then take the bus to the Jain Caves (30 to 34) and Cave 29 (did not know about the bus and walked all lot uphill under the hot sun) and then do my way back. This way you visit the top best spots while fresh!"
"While the Lonely Planet author suggests Ellora wins 'hands down' over Ajanta in the cave stakes, I disagree. Yes, the main temple here is exceptional, almost LoTR / GoT like and makes it worthwhile, however the rest of the caves aren't anything overly special. Ajanta caves are less showy but definitely more intricate, better maintained and in a far more remarkable setting on the meander of a river overlooking a steep gorge. This place desperately needs to be managed more effectively, a code of silence when entering the caves might also be in order, these are sacred places, and even if like myself you aren't religious they deserve respect for the dedication it took to hew them out of the side of a mountain. Instead you have haggles of loud, obnoxious, domestic tourists, visiting in large boisterous groups that pay scant regard to interior of the caves. This I found to be pretty disrespectful, and sad, it's your heritage, do you really care so little? You also have the usual 'one photo please' targeted at anyone with white skin, which I oblige, no point causing direct offence, but please, grow up, it's insulting, annoying and moreover extremely disruptive. Smacks of immaturity."
"I have now spent about four weeks traveling around India. The Taj Mahal is one of the seven wonders of the world, but does not make my top four list in India. Imagine starting at the top of a stony hill and carving a massive two-story multiple room temple about the size of a football field out of it. There may be a larger sculpture in the world (it is a monolithic piece of rock), but I am unaware. It was built from ~750-950 C.E. by an estimated 20 generations. The only things I can compare it to in my experience are Ajanta caves about 2 hours away, also in India, and Machu Picchu and Hampi (also in India). Ajanta is similar, but much different and one cannot easily describe it with words. Machu Picchu and Hampi are totally different, but also awesome. The fee for foreigners is 250 rupees, about $5. There are stairs to climb and the ground can be uneven. I would not recommend it for young children. I know a number of Indians who remember it from going as teenagers and are now reminded it needs to be on their bucket list for a revisit."
Ellora Caves are worth a visit. Make sure that you take a guide rather than just going through books and seeing it for yourself. The guide actually tells you the importance of each cave and most importantly the Kailash cave. You need a guide for this and its important carvings
Good part of these caves is you can take your car’s very near to gates(on permissible limits) secondly you get the guide book or guide to understand the importance & architecture of caves. I like to suggest you to hire a guide it will help you to explore the cave in better manner and you will save time & energy else you might miss some important cave. Other wise it’s very difficult to see the entire cave’s in one day. Hope my suggestion will help you in getting best.
"I don't highly recommend taking the state buses to this location, something private would be better, but this is definitely a site not to miss. It is a great connection to the past. Beautiful and amazing. The guides who hang around can be annoying but are knowledgeable if you are willing to take the chance and use one. It adds to the experience."
"My words out here would do little justification to Ellora Caves, as these caves are better experienced than reading out a review. As is splashed on many a web sites, these caves are divided into 3 categories - Buddhist, Hindu and Jaina caves. Even though there is quite a lot of information out there, the one notable characteristic missing is that of the acoustics of cave # 10. Hiring a guide was one good choice we made, as the guide was able to recite few Buddhist hymns and those chants were soothing and we felt a sense of peace prevailing all over us. Don't miss this out. And don't hesitate to go to the left corner and chant ""Buddham saranam gachaami"". With all the modern technology at our hand, we are unable to replicate what our ancestors have created - be it great Pyramids or Ellora caves, we are still puzzled at their skills."
"What move can I say than amazing. I've seen a lot of things but this is defiantly up there. Can not believe its not better known. There are 30 odd caves all dedicated to various religions (Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism) built between the 5th and 10th century. Cave 16 dedicated to Shiva (Hindu) is be far the most impressive (not to belittle the others). The cave looks like a multistory building but was in fact carved out of a single piece of rock. To look on it is awe inspiring. I suggested climbing the outside of this cave to look down into it to truely comprehend what they achieve when they created this temple."
"Ellora caves is a few kilometres from the Aurangabad city the road to ajanta it seems was very bad so I did not go and left it for the next time... It seems there are many caves in ellora and they are numbered from 1 to 32 if I'm not mistaken...but to go to the number 32 u have to go in their bus coz your private transport does not go further from a certain point ....I preferred to take a guide as advised by my friend glad that we followed the advice as he did not let us waste our time on the caves that were a replica of the Main one for example number 8 & 9 was replica of number 10 supposedly to get to the number 10 which was a better version of 8 or 9 ... because in olden times they had to practice on 8 and 9 to get to the better or should I say more perfect version which was number 10 :).... And then it was the number 16 cave which was huge and had lot of wheelchair accessibility, for the number 10 I had to be picked up on the wheelchair and taken inside... And I heard from the employee of that place that they were making most of them the main ones atleast wheelchair friendly, it was in the process....on the entrance when we got out there were monkeys that you could feed with bananas....it was really a beautiful thing to do and a lovely site to see... Definitely I would like to visit again to catch up with the other caves which I missed on It was worth taking the effort to be picked up in the wheelchair and taken inside there are lot many caves.... this was a number 10, the guide that waswith us was very nice he told me that I should go inside and have a look I am glad I went inside,it is quiet and dark ...it seems that the other caves like 8 & 9 of the similar kind were made as a practice to get to the best one... There are quite a lot of steps flight of a four steps to get down and then another four steps to get up but the good news is that they are in the process of making this cave also wheelchair friendly like the number 16 which is already wheelchair friendly. It was number 16 cave (Kailasha Temple) which was quite wheelchair friendly from one side of it on the other side where there is the temple and the big elephant there is a ramp I am so glad I got to visit this cave as it has the most beautiful creativity.... There is lots to see, there is ramayana there is Mahabharata in that whole area... I could not go on the other side of the cave probably I will visit again for the same... I click some lovely pictures from all the sides the staff there was very nice and helpful.... Is a must visit because of its skilled creativity..."
"We visited in September when the atmosphere was cloudy and pleasant. The caves and temple complex was serene. The gardens were fresh and manicured. The surroundings were decently clean. Btw, the pungent smell in some caves mentioned in some earlier posts is that of bats. There is room for improvement in the cleanliness department in the Jain and Buddhist caves. The Kailash temple which is the highlight was breathtaking. If you are short on time, I suggest you visit the Kailash temple only. We had hired a ASI licensed guide for Rs. 1600 for 6 people. It took an hour and a half for the Kailash temple. And another hour and half for the Buddhist and Jain caves. The Jain caves are 1.5 kms from the Kailash temple. ST provides a round trip shuttle bus service for Rs. 20 per person. The buses are old and in a rundown condition. The ST employees are disinterested, arrogant and lazy. On our way back from the Jain temples, we were made to wait for 30 mins. The driver was busy chatting way on his phone and the ticketing lady was eating and chatting with the vendors. When we requested them to drop us back to the main gate, they said they will wait for a group that they had dropped off. They turned a blind eye to us, when we reasoned with them that the group could take another half hour. It took some threatening from our side to convince them to start the bus and take us back to the main gate. Maharashtra State Transport and their employees ruined our overall visit experience. The authorities should take a look at the shuttles bus facilities at world class tourist sites over the world. The Ellora caves are simply awe-inspiring and one of a kind. A small glitch should not make the tourist experience mediocre. A simple warm smile from the employees is enough for tourists to feel welcome."
"I have been to this place 2 times earlier and this time i decided to go their with my parents and my brothers family. As i was staying in shirdi, there are suv’s available for rent which will take you to the place with a itinerary to the nearby places. When you reach the venue there is small entrance where you have to buy the tickets to enter. As my parents are above 60, i got bus tickets for reaching out to caves on the other end. Its a big stretch of caves spread in around 3-4 kms length. Caves are really well built and maintained well. You can see the shiva sculptures and one kf the cave is dedicated for buddhism. Big carving on the mountains wins your heart immediately. Must visit if you are in India."
"A good place to visit.Visited the place on 18.1.2018 by hiring a car from Aurangabad. Around 3 hours required to view Ellora caves..You can purchase the ticket from the spot by paying 30 rupees or through internet.We bought the ticket through internet ASI site.The car dirver M.D.Hussain was a reliable man helped us and give adequate time to view the caves.Anyone interested can contact the person.We visited Ajanta caves and Ellora caves in oine day.It is better to visit Ajanta in one day and Ellora in next day to explore the caves.We started early morning 6 am and reached 8.45.am to ajanta after break fast..After completing the Ajanta caves 1.15 pm,we move to Ellora.We are very happy with the tour to ajanta and ellora and thanks to M.D.Hussain,our driverwho gave a clear picture about ajanta,ellora and aurangabad..Anyone wish to travel can contact Hussain through e-mail:mdhusain5494@gmail.com or 9923616671,8855835494..Guides are available at both the caves by paying Rs.1600/-Government approved rate..."
"Ellora caves has 34 caves. Some are incomplete. Cave no. is the most gorgeous one. This is called as Kailas temple. Sculptures are exquisite. The cave remain open from 6AM to 6PM Bus from Aurangabad is the cheapest mode of communication to reach Ellora caves and charges onlu Rs. 36 per head. The Central bus station at Aurangabad is near the Aurangabad railway station. The bus stop at Ellora is just in front of the Ellora caves. It takes 45 minutes to reach by bus from Aurangabad and there are ample of bus service. The first bus starts at 5:45 AM from Aurangabad. Govt. approved guide takes Rs. 1300, which is very expensive. Instead, I would suggest to buy a book from the ticket counter. The book only costs Rs. 60. Refrain from buying books from local vendor who charges more and those books have no information at all."
"During Dushehra vacation I visited Shirdi and stayed there two days. On 12th I left Shirdi for Aurangabad by a SUV taxi which charged us Rs 3000/- for dropping us at Aurangabad including four halts at Ghrishneshwar Mahadev temple, Ellora, Daulatabad fort and lying Hanuman temple. We were four adults and 4 children. Leaving Shirdi at 8 am we reached Jyotirlinga temple at around 11 am. The temple was not crowdy and we had got the holy darshan and Abhishek puja of Lord Shiva in just 45 minutes. Thereafter we took lunch in nearby Vrindavan Pure Veg hotel. At 12.15 pm we entered Ellora caves. Since I had already obtained online tickets for entry, I was not required to stand in queue. But surprisingly the staff of ASI posted there were not aware about online tickets and I was bound to wait for their approval. Ministry should train their staff at such important places about e-facilities. Passing through security systems, we moved towards caves. All Ellora monuments were built by Hindu dynasties, such as the Rashtrakuta dynasty who built some of the Hindu & Buddhist group of caves, and Yadav dynasty who built some of the Jain group of caves. Cave no 16 The Kailash temple was built by Rashtrakuta ruler Krishna I. We were hypnotized to see the creation. How, when & in how many days were the reactions of every visitor. We were astonished to see the huge temple promises and were thinking about those artists who built this magnificent temple by cutting the mountain. Cave no 16 of Ellora features the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world, the Kailasha temple, a chariot shaped monument dedicated to Lord Shiva. Though Government of India is taking sincere efforts to safeguard this structure, but being a monument of 8th A.D. this is facing existing issue. Hope, our future generation would also get opportunity to see such world heritage creation. In brief, there are 34 caves- 1 to 12 belong to Buddhism, 13 to 29 to Hinduism and rest four belong to Jains. Cave no 1 to 16 can be seen by walking a distance of 350 meters but for cave no 17 to 34 there ply shuttle buses. These caves were excavated out of the vertical basalt cliff in the Charanandri hills. Accompanied by two kids we were restricted to stop ourselves soon. We were tired and due to time restriction we had to move for Aurangabad and this made us ended our Ellora journey at about 2 pm.The caves are mind-blowing and irresistible. I would suggest that 1. Reach early in the morning after taking healthy breakfast/lunch. 2. Carry water bottles. 3. If you want to preserve its memory, do carry a DSLR camera and 4. Learn all the history about Ellora caves before visiting it. Thanks."
"In the line of my review of Ajanta Caves, this review of the caves will discuss about the facilities and not the actual caves. Caves themselves are beautiful and paintings inside are outstanding, but well this is something we all know and I think such man made wonders should not be 'reviewed' in a conventional sense. So I'll discuss the facilities. The caves are much closer to Aurangabad city than Ajanta Caves approx 30 km ( half an hour drive), so getting there is less of a pain. Taxies can be easily available from the city which is by far the most convenient and hassle free option. As far as I know, there are no public transport options. There are few MSRTC (Maharashtra State Transport Corp) buses but their schedule needs to be confirmed beforehand and they are not the most comfortable option. After the car is parked the ticketing queue is at a walkable distance. Queues unlike that of Ajanta caves move fast. Guides are available at a reasonable price. Do NOT try to cut corners by going on your 'own' and not hiring a guide as you will not understand and appreciate hidden details. The expanse of the caves is actually quite vast so much so that to see some caves, you actually need to drive for few kilometres. But compared to Ajanta these caves are less physically demanding. Its ok if you skip distant caves and just concentrate of the central caves and the Kailash temple. Unfortunately there are decent food and beverage options nearby. Restrooms are available but I did not need to use them so can't comment. Coming to Kailash temple.. frankly speaking, I've never seen anything like this before. This temple, carved out of entire stone, is a true man made wonder. Words can't describe it and pictures can't do justice. All in all it is a crime to visit Aurangabad and not to visit this attraction!"
Ellora caves are close to Aurangabad city. It can be covered in half day. It consist of 32 small-large caves whereas Cave no 16 i.e. Kailash temple cave is major attraction. Carving in caves is simply amazing. Little bit unclean as compare to Ajintha caves. Parking charges for car is INR 20/- whereas entry fee is INR 10 per person. No camera charges whereas video camera chargers are INR 25/- You need around 3 hours to see important caves. Cave no 16 is must visit cave. Carving on temple is beautiful. Different mythology stories are carved on walls which is around temple area. you can visit on 2nd floor to see rooms and carving. To have a top view of Temple. Take a left side path which will take you to the top of hill. It gives you a best view. There is nothing much left in other caves but good to watch in quick time. It is a must visit place for sure
"Ellora Caves are a 35-40 minute drive from Aurangabad.Entry fee is 250 rupees,the caves are closed on Tuesdays.The best way to view the caves is to drive to the farthest point ,which are the Jain temples 31-34.Next drive south to the Hindu temples(13-29) and park the car.The rest of the caves(Buddha 1-12) can be explored from this area. Many of the caves have 2 levels with staircases.Some caves will require removing your shoes.The caves will have many picture opportunities both inside and outside of the caves.Some sculptures have some minor reconstruction. Cave 16 is the big attraction and it contains the major temple.THERE IS A CLIFF next to the temple,which you can easily climb for panoramic pictures of the temple area. The Ellora caves can easily be done in a half day and can be combined with the fort and little Taj.The Ajanta caves are a 2 hour plus drive from Aurangabad and require close to a full day.If you want to see the paintings you will need to go to Ajanta Caves."
"The first time I ever visited the Ellora caves in April 2012 left an impression of wow in my mind. Entry tickets: INR 250 for foreigners and INR 10 for Indian and SAARC Citizens Entry of vehicles of course is not allowed till the caves, but is allowed till the perimeter entry of each cluster of caves. Walk from the vehicle drop off to cave entry is an average of 300 mtrs. Guides are available at the ticket counter itself who can speak Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, English and French as far as I know. The standard rates for the guides vary from 1250 - 2500 INR. A must see if you are in Aurangabad. The caves are periodically maintained by the ASI structurally and aesthetically."
"It is 30 km (18.64 miles) from Aurangabad & the road is in very good condition. Please buy the tickets from the ticket counter at the entrance gate itself; also you can refill your water bottle near the info board at the entrance gate. Guides charges are Rs.750, it is better you buy a guide book of ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) available at the ticket counter or at Bibi-Ka-Maqbara (Aurangabad), so that you can study a day before. 1. Don’t ever think to visit both (Ajanta & Ellora) caves in a day. 2. The canteen which is on right side of Cave 16 is hopeless. 3. Pirates CD whose MRP (Maximum Retail Price ) is Rs.75 each of both caves ,you can get it for Rs.40 to 50 both. Pre-requisites: 1. Torch 2. Good study of the caves. 3. Stamina to climb & walk a lot (Whole area is of about 2.5 to 3 Kms) & lots of water & snacks. Once you enter the campus, you can see the Cave 16 Kailash which is the main attraction of all. Don’t forget to get to see the top view of the same, for this there is a staircase at the entrance gate on the left side. After that watch the Caves 15 to Cave 1 which are on the right side of the Cave16. After that move to Cave 17 to Cave 24 on the left side of Kailash .Come back to Cave 16 take your vehicle & then go to cave 20 to Cave 29 else continue your journey till Cave 29 Again from Cave 20 take your vehicle & go for the Cave 30 to Cave 34 which are the Jain Caves. Last but not the least ,don’t forget to visit the Ghrishneshwar Temple where photography is prohibited. It is about 0.8 Km ( 0.5 mile ) from main entrance gate."
"Ellora was excavated a lot later than Ajanta. If have time only for the best, do not miss Cave 10, 16 and 32. Cave 10 is dedicated to Carpenters because the interior details replicates wood. Notice the ceilings. Cave 16, was originally white, to resemble Mount Kailash, the home of Lord Shiva, in the Himalayas. Cave 32 has magnificent bas reliefs of the Jain tirtankaras."
Agree with all the other reviews - this is a truly awe-inspiring place to visit. I highly recommend getting a guide at the gate - the prices are fixed and unless you've already read a lot about the caves you will definitely miss out on much of the detail without someone to explain it. Our guide showed us 5 caves in 2.5 hours. Without him we likely would've missed some of the highlights as you can't see all the caves in one day. He was also able to time our visits well with the shuttle bus to the Jain caves so we didn't have to spend any time waiting around. Highly recommend Vilas as a guide - he spoke very good English and was very professional and knowledgeable.
"The Wikipedia describes this UNESCO heritage vastly so what difference can this review make to this cultural site frozen in time?! Thousands from across the globe flock this monument; some out of awe others as a part of a group and still others to tap the history behind this monolithic structure. Though the site is swept clean by the local staff; irresponsible tourism still persists. You can find discarded fanta cans and mineral water bottles in the interior structures. People still squat on the structures.Hawkers keep pestering you with their wares from drinking water; selfie sticks; beaded jewellery to carved artefacts; books and postcards. Well everyone has to make a living but when you need some peace and time to imbibe the cultural aspects you feel like the structure is shifted from its serene surroundings to a busy market street. Inside the monument compound one set of washrooms were under lock and key.The existing set of toilets were pathetically maintained. The lady manning the place says people do not pour water and if its made ""pay and use ""then too people complain. Imagine you visit a UNESCO accredited site and basic facilities are absent. The artistically carved structures mutely witness the degeneration of its surroundings. The pathways to the caves are still not cleared of weeds and unwanted rubbish. If you want to walk all around the existing caves on a sultry warm day; there are no periodic shelters. The lone banyan tree that stands testimony to the countless tourists that flood this monument is the sole respite. But hardly would you have taken a seat and the hawkers surround you. Outside the main gate too its utterly chaos with hawkers selling hats; water; etc. stray dogs and cattle. Eateries are unhygienically maintained. There is no mechanism to regulate traffic though pick and drop facility can be more systematically maintained. There is a parking area alloted. Wheel chairs are offered at a price to the needy. They can be used only till the structures though some are carried inside too. This beautiful culturally rich monument deserves better upkeep and administration for genuine tourists to admire and cherish."
"Caves 1 to 16 can be visited by walk. When you arrive and park your car, there is a small Maharashtra Tourism Dept run canteen. Have some decent food there. You have to walk 2 to 3 km. The caves are spread across a 4km stretch. You need to pay Rs. 20 and buy and entry ticket. This is in the form of a RF token. You need to carefully keep it as you need it while exiting. If you lose this token, they charge you a heft Rs. 200/- fine to replace it. When you enter using the token, you will see the cave 16. This is an important cave to visit. Carved from top and it is a Hindu cave called Kailash cave. Spend good amount of time there. If you need to have a top view, go around and climb (trek) the small hill. It is worth the climb. You will get an awesome view. Then take a walk in descending order to cave 1. Important one to see in 16 to 1 are cave 14 (Ravana Ka Khai), 12 (Teen Tal or 3 storied cave), 11 (Dho Tal or 2 storied cave). Then come back to cave 16 where you started and take a bus. Fees (Rs. 21). They are supposed to go from cave 16 to 34 stopping at any cave stops requested by the passengers. But, they take you directly to cave 34 only. You can trek back a 2 to 3 km seeing cave in descending order again. Important cave in this stretch are: 34, 33, 32 (Indra Sabha). Cave 33, 32 are interconnected. Worth seeing. Do not miss.Cave 29 (Dumar Lena), Cave 21 (Rameshwara Cave). While returning back, if interested see Jyothi Linga Temple which is about 1 or 2 km from Ellora caves"
"There are around 30 caves and in case you intend to see all of them it will take fully day i.e. 6-8 hours. The speciality of the caves are that whatever you see is not built, it is carved out from the rock. It is big huge and peaceful. Suitable time is early morning as during noon it becomes very hot. Take comfortable shoes along with you as it requires a lot of walking and climbing. At times you are required to remove your shoes as well. So take the most comfortable one. You can take guide if you with to, or read it yourself. The place is very picturesque, so do take a lot of them. There is parking space available, there is entry fee, and there are many eateries outside."
"Third time visited Ellora Caves. Won't mind visiting again. The caves are still in good condition. The area is maintained well. Cave no. 16 is the main attraction. The first thing you should do is, park your vehicle only at MTDC parking place. Use second entry point when you are travelling from Aurangabad. (After passing the Ellora caves entrance). The entry fee is Rs. 50-60. It is double if you enter from 1st gate managed by contractor. Don't waste your money as you don't get facility or service from 1st gate entry. After parking your vehicle, first see the beautiful museum- 5 min walk from parking. Then walk down back to parking area. Maharashtra State government has provided you bus service at Rs. 21 per head. Buy the tickets. They require minimum 3 tickets for starting a trip. If nobody is there buy 3 tickets. The bus will drop you inside the Ellora Caves gate. Buy the entry ticket. See first Cave no. 16. Then come back to Bus stop opposite of the cave. The same Bus ticket is valid for visiting other caves. The buses drop you near the caves, Use this nice facility provided by government. Same ticket you should use for returning to MTDC parking area. Do carry water bottle and food. Help environment and the government by disposing the waste generated in dustbins only. Enjoy it."
"First let me clarify one thing, These are not caves. Caves are naturally formed, and are primarily used by wild animals for shelter. What you see in Ellora are man made temples, place of shelter for monks who wants to meditate. It took more than 500 years to complete these structures, and calling them as caves is disrespecting them. Ellora has structures for Buddism/Hunduism/Jainism. None of the structures are damaged by other religion people. This shows how in those days,they respect other religions. There is a Kailasa Temple, which is the largest monolithic temple in the world. Entire temple is carved from top to bottom. I feel this should be included in ""World Wonder"". It tool 200 years to complete this temple. Photos wont do justice. You have to see to believe such a thing really exist. Tips: 1) Time to Cover: It takes 3-4 hours to cover all important caves. Jain caves are located 1.5 kilometers from main entrance. Only way to visit these are via government shuttles. Allocate adequate time.These are meant to observe,study, inspire. 2) Take Goverment Guides: Please take Goverment guides. Cannot insist on importance of guide for Ellora and Ajantha. Government Guides charge - 1350/per 4 people. You can tag along with other couples,thats what we did. Please dont take local guides. Trust me they know nothing. Things to Avoid: Dont take Food inside: Lot of monkeys you find at entrance. There are high chances of monkeys snatching your food. Avoid carrying food items with you. Archeological departent has put in lot of effort in maintaining the complex,lets help them keeping this place clean."
we started at aurangabad in a taxi at 12:30 pm visited ellora from 1:30 to 4:30 then started to shiridi completed sai dharshan at 9 pm on same day . i have never saw such honesty taxi driver make our trip joyful . within a short time and good money. MD hussain taxi driver (08855835494/09923616671). he provided good services for less money.good taxi driver.
"Much is already written about this place, few things to bear in mind, do engage a govt guide but do not trust the rate card they are carrying showing short, mid level and long tour. All the Govt guides are old so even if you take long tour, it would be short only. Govt must look into this. Do not pay them more than Rs.1000/- per day. Beware of fake stuff being sold just outside the monument. Best is to ignore the sellers. Carry plenty of water. Its get hot walking and walking a lot. We spent almsot 2 hours in one of the caves and visited cave no 16 (Kailasa Temple) twice. Truely wonderful unforgettable experience."
"Ellora caves , one of the heritage sites in India are at a distance of about 28 km to the west of Aurangabad, Maharashtra. The carvings of these caves dates back between 7th and 9th centuries Ad and are world famous. In all there are 34 caves,out of which - 12 caves (1to12) are Budhist; 17 are Hindu or Brahmanic (13 to 29) and the remaining five (30 t0 34) represent Jainism. JAIN CAVES (30 to 34) are at a distance. We (4 members) took an auto to visit these and come back. We bargained and paid Rs400/-(transport & guide service) . Jain caves are more artistic than Budhist and Hindu caves. These caves belong to Digambara sect of Jainism. There are beautiful carvings of Mahaver, Parswanath and Gomateshwar. HINDU CAVES: some of the importance caves are; Cave No.14 : many interesting carvings of various Hindu Gods / Goddesses are seen in the two panels. Tha main attraction is the scene depicting Ravana trying to shake th Kailash Mountain. The bull Nandi is in front of the cave. Cave No.15 : This is a two storied one. A scene depicting the marriage of siva with Parvathi and a Siva Linga and the figures of Ganesh and karthikeya can be seen Cave No. 16 : This is called"" Kailasha"" and this is the most remarkable of the carved shrines. It is a two storied Siva Temple, carved and chisselled out in a single rock. The cave mostly depicts stories from Ramayana and Mahabharata. The main attractions in this cave ,comprising of three separate buildings are : at the entrance is the sculpture of a beautiful Gajalakshmi, sitting in lotus flower with four elephants two on each side and pouring water on the Goddess; a tall piller (dhwajasthambha) in the middle and finally in the cave the sculpture depicting Ravana trying upsetting Siva in the Kailash , the figures of Vishnu as Narasimha Avatar and Lord Narasimha subduing Hiranyakasipa. cave No.21 : is called Rameshwara. in front is a nandi and inside a fine carving of Goddess ganga, equisitely carved and karthikeya with Goddess Yamuna. Besides a scene depicting Siva parvathi kalyanam can be seen. Cave No.29 ; is the second best cave after Kailash (16), popularly known as Sitha nahani (Sitha`s bathing place). The path leading to the cave has 2 lion figures. There is a very beautiful and exqisitive figure of siva in dancing posture as Nataraja.. Cae no.22 is called Neelakantha because of bluish colour of linga. cave No.23 The figure of Brahma, Vishnu Maheswara as trimurthy is there. Cave No. 28 is under water falls and hence called as Dhara tirth. The entry fee was Rs.50 per person. If interested to see Jain caves, take an auto from there as they are familiar. Others are easily accessible except that one need a guide if wants to know details at length. Lot of parking place is there. Small dhabas/canteens are available to satisfy the apetite. No restrictions in carrying mobiles and photography. 3 hours time may be needed. A little amount of walking ,climbing of steps is involved. Ghrishneswar Jyotirling temple is less than 2 kms from here."
"Location: 30kms from Aurangabad town and 340 kms from Mumbai. Roads are extremely bad. Entry Ticket: Ticket of Rs.10 for cars and Rs.10 per visitor. For International Tourist entry is Rs.250. ($4) Parking/Car Entry: No Charges for Parking. As the caves are spread over 2-3 kms to taking your car is advisable. Water/Snacks: Few shops selling chips/coldrinks/water outside few caves. You need not carry too much water. Walk/Climb: If you have your own vehicle you won’t have to climb much. But walking- certainly! You need lot of energy. Whether: Its very hot between April - October. Very exhaustive. Waking so long will be very tiring There are 34 caves and you need to walk a lot to cover all of them. As some of the caves are empty or are repetitive so one may have to skip few in order to cover all the caves. The minimum time required will be 3-4 hrs and it is easy to spend 6-8 hrs in case you visit all the temples. The key is to plan properly otherwise it would be difficult to cover all the caves in a day’s time. We hired a guide who took us first to cave No. 29, then to cave no 22/21 and then to cave no 16. We visited other caves on our own. I would suggest that, as cave no 16 is the most beautiful and will take maximum amount of time so it is best to see this cave first (located close to entry gate) then move right side and cover 1st to 15th caves next. Cave No 1-16 are located close to each other in a cluster and can be covered at one go and should take 3-4 hrs. The other important caves 21,22,27,29 should be cover at the end. Cave 16 itself should take 2 hrs. There is a temple on first floor so you will have to remove your shoes inside. Otherwise unlike Ajanta Caves, you won’t not have to remove your shoes outside each cave. Ask for authorised guides only at the ticket counter. Other guides are not allowed to enter the caves. Audio guides not yet introduced. Accommodation: Hotel Kailash is located very close to the entry gate with view of caves. No other decent hotel in the area. Rate Rs.3500 per night. Do visit Grishneshwar temple (Shiva Temple) which is located within walking distance. Eat: Only good restaurant is Vrindavan Restaurant."
the caves are around 35kms from aurangabad a short ride or drive good to visit but would say the ajintha caves around 110 kms is a better bet
"This is just an amazing site comprising 34 Buddhist, Hindu and Jain caves and temples carved out of solid rock faces; The largest, kailasa Temple, is estimated to have taken up to 200 years to carve out of the rock. As many as 2000 workers participated in the removal of up to 400000 tons of rock. This is, I believe, the world's largest monolithic sculpture."
"For a Westerner, these transimagine not as Caves but as Cathedrals. Their size, splendour, beauty are lost inside of the word “cave.” As a unit, they are one of the most astonishing man-made structures I have seen. As many have said, you simply cannot do justice to them in a day – you get the astonishment but not the subtlety and understanding – certainly not as a non-Indian. And use the “guides” – any guide. Even the least qualified – (do not be dismissive - this is their only livelihood) - and for a pound, dollar or euro or 100 Rupees - they will know far more than you. And not just about the Temples. I especially recommend “Kahn” with his amazing “Bag of Stones”: moonstones, agates, split stones to reveal such beautiful crystalline worlds. Just ask for him after the entrance – all guides, hawkers and tut-tut men come to know each other over the years."
"Ellora caves is a collection of 34 caves. It can be divided into 3 sets.12 Buddhist (caves 1–12), 17 Hindu (caves 13–29) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves. Among these 16th one is the most important one. The first entry will be to this cave only. After that you can start the visit from cave 1. The first 29 caves are nearby. To visit Jain caves you have to walk about 15mns from cave 29. After visiting the Jain caves, you have to take an Auto to return to the starting point. I visited Ellora caves after visiting the Ajanta caves. Ellora caves needs more time to visit.In terms of beauty, Ellora caves is just ahead of Ajanta caves. Taking a guide with you is always preferred. Other wise you wont be able to understand the meaning of the caves. It will be better if you are ready to spent a full day here."
"The caves progress from east to west from Buddhist to Hindu to Jain. The total span from one end to the other is considerable, so comfortable footwear, sunscreen and a cap are a must. Although there are a few caves which are just empty chambers the majority are decorated with beautiful sculptures. It is difficult to imagine how the sculptors, with hand held chisels and hammers, could create the immense Kailashnath Temple. The small canteen is adequate for rehydration with soft drinks, water or lassi. The nearby Kailash Hotel restaurant has multiple options for breakfast, lunch or dinner"
"Only a 30 minute drive from Aurangabad. After an enjoyable visit to Ajanta, my day at Ellora definitely raised the game. Astonishingly large caves, and the Jain set of caves were a nice change in architectural styling (after ppending all day already at Ajanta). If you can get your driver to drop you at the Jain caves, then drive you to the next set of upper caves, and finally drive you to the reception centre then you will do less walking."
"Ellora Caves is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. Not only becaused the huge dimensions and because every single statue was carved using the same one stone. It was also because I was able to see Hindi, Budist, and Jain caves. All of them with a very different artistic style. For example, Kailash cave y kind of barroque but there are some other caves which used to be buddist monasteries so, they are very auster, almost classic occidental style. Get yourself ready to give a very long walk if you want to cover all caves. 3 hours would do it. Bring also confortable shoes and enough water. Don't miss the monkey who are roaming around the entrance and begging for bananas! Nice show."
"Ellora Visit Why: My first longest drive in one go - ended up with 946 Km. Parents had come, so was a great family outing with Friday off from office. When: Friday early morning (6AM) Sunday late evening (10PM) back. How: Took the Mumbai - Expressway exit Talegaon check naka - Chakan - Shikrapur take left for Nagar road - Shirur - Ahmednagar - Aurangabad - Ellora. The road is largely good except Talegaon - Shikrapur ... where the road is good but it's single way so you always head oncoming traffic your way. The day traffic really did not bother much but the evening return was little painful. The total distance one way to Ellora was near 400 Km & it took us total 9 Hrs ... including 1 Hr break in between. Journey Forward: We started early morning at 6 AM from Powai. Early morning city traffic on a Friday for a surprise was quite heavy at those dark early hours. Sooner we hit the expressway it was a nice experience with cool breeze around. As we entered the ghats of Lonavala we saw a big Q of traffic and a big jam. We got jammed for more than 45 mins. At one point it seemed we too got to go back like others ... The steep slope & some loaded trucks got stranded. Also there was some procession (which we found later through out our journey) where some elderly people were taking some ""babaji"" in a chariot kind of thing to somewhere ... Finally we came out of the traffic after Lonaval flyover ... Took the leftmost lane while entering the Talegaon check naka ... else you miss the Chakan road & got to go via Pune city (which is I think some 20 Km extra). The Talegaon - Chakan road was not very busy till we hit the outskirts of Chakan. The office goers flocked the road with bikes, autos & cars. Some traffic in Chakan & as we moved towards the Shikrapur Junction, the road again became quite quiet and pleasant. It's 9:30 already & we started feeling hungry. We were looking for some food court and got one complete desi. We had vada-pav, pav-bhaji & a solid tea! Full on energy, we resumed the journey. Reached Shikrapur, you need to take a left turn from here. The road is partitioned here so driving is a little tension free. However, some part of the road quality is really not great. Though you can be above 90, but that's some stress to your car. The rest of the journey through Shirur, Ahmednagar & Aurangabad was really great great fun. We reached to Ellora straight way as we had booked in Kailash Resort there. There will be a separate review on Kailash resort later. After check-in at 2:45 PM & a very quick rest, we started out for lunch at 3:15 PM. We had it in a restaurant just in front of the hotel The food was not really good neither value for money. We had a plan to go to Aurangazeb's tomb & Daulatabad fort, & if time permits to cover Biwi ka maqbara also. Guess what all of a sudden, it started raining heavily! Driving through the ghats of Ellora was a real fun, till we reached the Khuldabad 4 Km away from the Ellora forts to find out the Aurangabad's tomb place in very shoddy state. We decided to dodge it as it was full of water & muds around. I had full sympathy for him after I saw the Biwi ka Maqbara the next day. Left for the Daulatabad fort. Daultabad Fort: We reached the fort at 4:30 PM, luckily the rain had stopped by that time. Free parking was available outside the fort. The fort really pushed the adrenaline up the spine. What a grandeur! The fort is under ASI, so you need to paye 10/- per head. But to that extent it was really not maintained that well. This fort was built by the Yadava's in 12th century to establish their supremacy over Chalukyas. (Don't read much in the Wikipedia about the history, like most of Indian history they have cooked-up many facts to present). The fort area was earlier known as Devgiri (Deogiri) by the locals till Ala-Ud-Din Khiljis & Malik Kafurs & Md. Bin Tughlaks captured & plundered much of its glories. It's sad to learn that such a fortress could be captured in less than 100 years by the enemies. But the story of betrayal in Indian history continued and some of Yadavass own let Ala-ud-din capture the fort in deceit. It was really nothing to be proud of for those Muslims! But after that it was all rubber rulers placed on the throne to control the fort from Delhi Sultanate. This fort suddenly became very important to control the whole of Deccan. During Md. Bin Tughlaq's reign, he made a historical blunder of assuming Daulatabad as the central control point for the whole Dynasti, but soon had to go back to Delhi leaving the Daulatabad area to the Bahamanis from them the ownership of the fort went to the Nizams. The Mughals had come to Delhi by that time. The two different sects of Muslims (Mughals & Nizams) started fighting to capture the fort & make foray to the southern parts of the country - the Bijapur & Golconda. Akbar & Shah Jahan were not completely successful to capture the fort till Aurangazeb established himself as the viceroy of Deccan. The importance of the fort can be guessed by the number of hands it passed - Yadavas, Khiljis, Bahamanis, Nizams, Mughals, Marathas, Peshwas ... again to Nizams and finally to the Marathis. Well that's the brieft history about the fort. The present of the fort is no less wonderful! It's magnanimous structure makes you think how ignorant & incapable we are. So many civil engineers around, so big developers ... can any body replicate it ... leave aside physically even on the drawing board? That tells the supremacy of people's knowledge about structures & constructions 1000 years back. It was made on a standalone conical shaped hill apart from the nearby ranges and three sides of it being covered by those ranges. So this effectively give it good visibility & protection from straight attack. The fort was quite well-planned to deceive a stranger. A grand porch will apparently take you to a corner to discover no way forward & retreat. Such traps start from the main entrance itself. After you figure out the entrance through the first door, you get stuck with a big trench filled with water and you are cut out in the main land and the fort is on an island. A narrow collapsible bridge connects the main land with the body of the fort. Once on the side of the main fort, you try to figure out the main entrance to the fort. There is only one opening which is completely dark passage (called Andheri), without your mobile torch open you really can't figure out your way. Then again some open area. Some fresh water reservoir. Again a dark staircase along the side of the hill, finally a set of long stairs to take you to the top. The top is full of breeze & a wonderful view around - lush green range of hills, full view of the town. Three of us could finally reach the top, my mom deserted it half-way. With heavy breath, taught thigh & cuff muscle when we sat at the top with soothing breeze around soon the sweats were gone. They had three cannons on the top at different layers each separated at approximately 120 degrees. Again I wondered how these cannons are still withholding the vagaries of weather especially where heavy monsoons pour gallons of water. They were made of brass with beautiful smoothness. The largest one could easily weigh more than 20 Tonne! I don't know even how they pulled it up atop the hill! Finally we head back towards the base ... the basement had a few tea stalls. We rested a bit ... the up & down had really taken a beaten on my legs. My left foot thumb were paining & both legs were quite noticeably trembling. Back to base ... it started raining again. Grishneshwar: Next day morning, first thing we had to do was visit the twelfth Jyotirlinga. It was 5 mins walk from Kailash resort. Like trimbakeshwar, rules were same - no mobile, no shoes etc. Queue was not big enough early morning. Some devotees from Andhra were all that were there. And we were so blessed to have a wonderful darshan. We had to take off clothes on upper half of the body. We went the inside the sanctum, could touch the lingam, pray spend some time & come out. So peaceful. Parents spent some time praying in the hall. The temple seemed to have been the recent one. On the sculptures on the pillars, I could see some english clad person with gun running after a deer! So guns had come & perhaps English were also in! However, I thought a little more maitenance should be done for all these temples. They had a trustee, but I'm not sure how well they are handling them. There was a Jain temple in the same area. We visited that also. Came out there was a restaurant - Vrindavan (they have lodging also). We had south Indian breakfast there. We had a plan to spend this day visiting Aurangabad & Ajanta. So we set out for Aurangabad to see Biwi Ka Makwara. Biwi Ka Makwara: From Ellora it's about 30 Km. You go past the BR Ambedkar's university & the Biwi Ka Makwara appears. This place is also under ASI, so pay 10/- per head & enter the Makwara. It was raining constantly. Prima-facie, it gives an appearance of Mini Taj for sure. We went inside & saw the cemetry resting in peace with lots of Rs 10/- notes on her tomb. Most of the visitors to this place were understandably Muslims. 30% Hindus & 5% foreigners (white skins). It was really, quick as I really did not find anything awesome! We started for Ajanta. Ajanta: This was one of the blunders in our whole plan. We drove through the city , whose roads were in pathetic conditions in the rain with large ditches & potholes all around. Somebody had told me earlier that the road to Ajanta from Aurangabad is maintained by the Japanese as they had some interest in preserving the Ajanta scultpures. More I went on those roads, I felt even if Chinese had maintained the roads it won't be in such a shabby shape. I kept driving with high hopes on those pathetic roads. Travelled 25 Km escaping two near collision situations & then finally took a decision to call it off after having travelled nearly 25 Km. Asked a couple of local shopkeeperes if the road were same ahead and they happily confirmed it won't be any better. So head back towards the city. We wanted to have the lunch in the Aurangabad city, my dad wanted to enter only some good Hindu restaurants. My quick search really didn't show up any near by. In one of the junctions, we found a Jagdamba meal service. It was a buffet system, the food was ok but quantities were really meagre. Finally we head back to our shelter Kailash resort. We decided that we'll cover Ellora today itself. But fate had something else planned for us. Sooner we entered the Ellora road, we faced a real bad traffic. The road has one place where there is an entrance for the Daulatabad city. May be earlier that was the main entrance to the city. Now the city is really not there but the entrance stays. And our govt has maintained the road through this passage only. Now this entrance was made at that point perhaps keeping in mind the largest vehicle at that point of time (a chariot?). Interestingly there is no road for that small patch of entrance. So only one vehicle can pass through it at one point of time. While we were leaving the city in the morning, we saw one truck just got stranded there. While coming back now, the same truck had caused an one hour traffic. Finally getting out of the traffic when we reached Ellora it was 5:00 PM. We had just one hour to visit Ellora today. Ellora: Ellora also being under ASI, you need to pay 10/- per head. We also had to pay for the vehicle another 10/-. You will find a lot of autorick drivers would ask you to park the vehicle in parking area and board their autos but we knew we can take them inside. However, we did not know the route plan & it was getting dark. So we did a little smart thing of following the autoricks that were plying inside. We saw all of them going in one specific direction. We followed one of them. Soon, we saw there were marking on the raods giving directions to specific cave numbers. We reached the end block of 30-34 caves which were built by the Jains in the last phase of construction around 800 AD. As it was our first one, the grandeur really amazed us. It just looked like an independent house. A temple in the middle of the yard, with an elephant on one side. All the caves I saw had some form of presence for this large animal - that tells how important part it has been for human civiliation to grow in those days! It had largely two floors, with many floors in between. Many rooms inside other rooms. At it was getting dark, we were afraid whether we will get lost somewhere inside. So we came out, it was a long day of travel & driving. Evening we came back to hotel. Morning it starts at 7:00 AM, we thought that we will start early, but could never make it on time. By the time we were in, it was 9:30 AM. We started from the last cave of the Hindus. It was really really grand. All the caves had incranation of Lord Shiva engraved on the rocks! Grand, really grand! Shiva-Parvati around, then lots of construction wonders ... I'm just falling short to express. After that many more Hindu caves as you come backward! Then came the cave 19 (?) which had the Kailash temple. Oh god! I never saw a temple anywhere so meticulously built! There was paining on the roof & the walls also. They say the Hoysalas made this temple & this was the first cave the Hindus made for more than 150 years! Then you go a little back & see the Buddhist caves ... they were really simple. But perhaps, there was need was not being grandiose, but just a monastery to learn & preach. But they were big & perhaps bigges with maximum utilization & utilities inside. Very minimal carvings on the rocks. We came out at 12:30 PM ... & now way back home. It was a long journey. I alway love driving, but now tired of writing any more ... so winding it up. Took the same road of onward journey. chakan road being single in the dark was little challenging. Took 1 hour more than the forward journey. Enjoy!"
"30 kms for main city iof Aurangabad, Dedicated to Lord Shiva, Mahavira, and Budha, these caves were built during various periods of 7th century till 12th century later on vandalised by the foreign invaders in 14/15 or 16th century. During that period these caves could not be maintained and whatever is left of them now is a masterpiece of Art, Stone crafting and the Architects of those times. Kailash Temple: The main attraction among all caves is the best one. you can spend One full day itself in the Kailash temple. Those who can walk for hours, can beat the day heat of India should visit these caves. No good hotel is available near these caves except Hotel Kailash with exorbitant prices. Traveller should stay at Aurangabad and visit these caves during day time. The whole campus on foot is almost 5-7 kms of walk...."
"Ellora Caves is situated at a distance of about 30 Kms from the city of Aurangabad in the Maharashtra State.. It is an Archaeological site built by the Rashtrakuta dynasty.. Ellora is a World Heritage Site. which represents the epitome of Indian rock-cut architecture. The 34 ""caves"" are actually structures excavated out of the vertical face of the Charanandri hills.. The history reveals that. Buddhist, Hindu and Jain rock-cut temples and Viharas and Mathas were built between the 5th century and 10th century. The 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12), 17 Hindu (caves 13–29) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves, built in proximity, demonstrate the religious harmony prevalent during this period of Indian history. It is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. These 34 monasteries and temples, extending over more than 2 km, were dug side by side in the wall of a high basalt cliff.,. Ellora, with its uninterrupted sequence of monuments dating from A.D. 600 to 1000, brings the civilization of ancient India to life. This is not only a unique artistic creation and a technological exploit but, with its sanctuaries devoted to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, it illustrates the spirit of tolerance that was characteristic of ancient India. One has to take a guide to know the details of the caves and its history. The best season/perod to visit is between October and February. Number of vehicles are available from Aurangabad to reach the spot. Good food is available at the caves."
"spent 2hrs at caves and there are well worth seeing, don't take any notice of tuk tuks at entrance all caves are within walking distance even 33 and 34, we did not have a guide but they are available just be sure to haggle a bit. We started at caves 1 to 15 leaving the big one until last. Arrived at 10am and was fairly quiet no queues or big groups. Paid 1200inr for taxi for day which included going to Fort as well."
"You need a full day to cover Ellora caves if you have interest in art, architecture and history. Please don’t try to club Ellora trip with Daulatabad or any other place except maybe Grishneshwar temple since it’s very near and you can complete that in an hour if you are lucky and there is not much rush at the temple. We took an auto from Aurangabad and it took us Rs. 800 for a full day visit. It’s always better to specify to the auto driver clearly that you will be returning only after the caves close (6.00 PM) and that he would need to take you from one cave to another since the caves are spread across a considerable area. This would avoid any bad experience with the auto driver later on. Do carry something to eat and drink since there are not many options available there. We went out for lunch to the nearby Kailash hotel in the afternoon during lunch time (the food was good) and came back and resumed our trip (no need to purchase tickets and parking slips again but inform the gatekeepers that you are going out for lunch only and intend to return). Do carry a torch. Please read a bit about all the three religions (Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism) before commencing your trip so that you atleast have a rough idea of what the caves stand for. Hiring a guide would be good. Alternately read a lot about the place before visiting. Buying those ubiquitous books on Ajanta and Ellora which are sold in the parking lots of either caves is also not a bad option though they will have only limited information (Rs.65 for a midsized version). The Kailash temple is just outstanding. You need atleast 2 to 3 hrs to just cover that. Some caves can be dark and lonely especially the higher floors. The climb also can be very steep. You can miss the higher floors of such caves. Also since a lot of climbing up and down is required please wear appropriate footwear. The Jain caves are fewer in number but I found them very beautiful. Don’t miss them though they are farthest from the main entrance. Be careful in case you are visiting the place in monsoons. The bathroom facilities at the caves are not good. Also elderly people can have a challenge climbing up and down all the stairs."
"One of the culturally rich places that makes you proud of your roots. We visited this place in early September and had a marvelous time. Just to imagine the kind of architectural /engineering ability Indians possessed all that time back is in itself a thought to behold. The caves are beautiful, and since most of the carvings are still intact, the story-telling is easier to relate to, more so than the Ajanta caves, where paintings are distorted and faded. A few points to keep in mind: 1. Guides are expensive. You will do well to pay Rs 20-30 to the cave gatekeeper and understand the carvings from him. Saves money and effort. 2. Start as early as possible. The caves, unlike Ajanta, are not placed beside each other and hence is a long tiring walk away. You can choose to not visit all, and ask locals' help to identify the main cave numbers and plan your visit accordingly. 3. Travel with car: If you have a driver along, keep him handy. Like I said, the caves are far away from each other. It would do better to visit one section of caves, and then drive down to the next section of caves rather than walking the whole way. 4. No shade: The walkway from one cave to another does not provide any shade, so carry an umbrella (especially during monsoon) or a cap for shade 5. Torch: Most of the caves have enough sunlight for you to easily view the details but a few caves (No. 16 which is also one of the major Hindu caves) have sections which do not have enough sunlight, so would recommend you carry one For those who want to shop, Paithani sarees are very famous in this region and some very fine handloom shops will fall while on your way back to Aurangabad from Ellora caves."
"Tips: 1. It’s a long walk and some climb. Be prepared with water and some snacks. 2. Car can be taken upto cave 16, 21 and 30. Use this facility. Consider taking an auto (available at car parking) if you don’t have a car. 3. Some caves are very average and can be safely skipped. Must see- 5,10,15,16, 21,32 4. You have to remove shoes before entering many of the caves. Be prepared to take off your shoes multiple times. 5. Carry a good torch. Its dark in caves. 6. Guide book is available in many stalls for rs 10. Its really good help. 7. Avoid the security at caves offering to be your “guide”. You are better off with authentic information in guidebook. 8. Camera allowed. You may consider a tripod if you are serious about photography. Please don’t climb on statues for shots. 9. It gets very crowded. Consider early start if you want to enjoy it in peace."
"It was my 2nd time that I visit Ellora caves as a part of Jytirlingas visit and I found it as interesting as it happened earlier .There are a total of 34 caves belonging to three different sects .Cave 1 to 12 represent Buddhist sect , 13 to 29 represent Hindu sect and 30 to 34 represent Jain sect .Cave no-10 also known as Biswakarmas cave is famous for its chaitya style with Buddha in a preaching pose . Cave no -16 popularly called as Kailash temple is famous for its magnificence build from a solid rock .Cave no- 32 called as Indra Sabha also is famous for its intricate design and beautiful sculptures ."
Do not skip Ellora caves if you are visiting Aurangabad. The caves are an experience of a life time. Really amazed by the great great work!
"Simply one of the most amazing places in India!! Bring sunscreen, a hat/cap, bottle of water and a lot of energy to see the 30+ caves in detail. Bring confortable shoes as you need to remove them before entering some of the caves"
"The caves are absolutely amazing! But what is being done to maintain these priceless treasures? UNESCO, where are you? We saw graffiti written on thousand year-old wall paintings. We saw Indian tourists jump up onto the carvings to pose for photos. One Indian girl climbed up and stood on Lord Buddha's feet while shaking her hips and smiling for the camera at her parents' urging. We were totally amazed at the lack of respect many Indians had for their own cultural heritage. And with the steep entrance fee, you'd think it would be possible to have a few toilets in working order."
"Great site, amazing caves and carvings, well worth a visit. We stayed in Aurangabad and got a taxi for the day for R900. Don't go on the organised tours, they try to fit too much into the day, we spent over 5 hours at the caves which was just enough time to see everything. To get a taxi go to the MTDC near the station, there are lots of people touting for buisness there. Lots of local tourists so be prepared for your photo being taken almost as much as you take them of the caves :) Take lots of water as there is only the chance to by it at the main car park. Most people stay near the main cave, once you get a few hundred meters away it gets very quiet and tranquil. Don't miss the most distant caves as they are fantastic."
"First - if you have a choice, visit the caves in the monsoon. Natural waterfalls occur all over the caves and you can actually walk under them. Start for Ellora early, depending on your interest in the place you can cover the place in either an hour, or even spend the whole day there! Make sure you wear a comfortable pair of shoes. Hire a guide, they can speak all languages so even foreign tourists shouldn't have a problem. While the Hindu and Buddhist Caves are close to each other, the Jain Caves are a distance away so you'll have to bundle your guide into your car and take him there. The caves have a basic canteen facility where you can have lunch and a wonderful cup of chai."
I have been to Ellora with my family members . It was simply superb .So many rock cut caves astonished us. Many tourists from foreign countries are making trips to ellora. Specially the Lord Shiva temple cut in single rock is magnificiant.we felt lot of thrill while we are entering into the caves. Tourist guides are also available to explain about the history of these caves. In these caves the Buddhist monks were used to medidate .
"The Ajanta Caves are mostly about paintings, and cameras with flashlights are prohibited, but the Ellora Caves are about sculptures. You need a minimum of 2 hours to visit all the caves, with the maximum being a whole day. No eatables are available inside; carry them if you need them. As you have to move under the sun for the maximum amount of time, it is recommended to carry water bottles, hats or umbrellas, and sunglasses. Ellora Caves are approximately 45–60 minutes drive from Aurangabad City, depending on time. If you start early by 9 a.m., then you can easily visit Bhadra Maruti Temple, Ghrishneshwar Temple, Ellora Caves, have lunch, and finally visit Daulatabad Fort on your return. Opening time: 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Rs. 40 is the entry ticket. There are 34 caves, but after entry, you first come across cave No. 16, which is the most visited cave. But go to your right side towards Cave No. 1 and start your journey from there towards Cave No. 16. Take maximum time in Cave No. 16. Take pictures from above the temple and also from inside. There is an e-rickshaw available for caves No. 29 to 34 for Rs. 35 per head. The e-rickshaw stand is just near the entry gate. The rickshaw will drop you off at one cave and leave you with other tourists. You took your own time visiting and came back with another e rickshaw.The same thing happens in all these caves. So keep your e-rickshaw ticket with you every time. Don’t dare to go to these caves by foot. These are very long-distance caves; otherwise, you may skip them."
"I started my journey to Aurangabad, where the Ellora caves and other important historical sites are located, by road from a place about 50 kilometers away from the entry point of the Samruddhi Mahamarg (SMM) at the Nagpur end. I left at 7:20 in the morning and arrived at the SMM entry point at 8:40. I knew that the SMM is a ""no stopping, no standing"" expressway, so I took a break before entering it to eat some snacks and drink some water. The distance to Aurangabad was almost 500 kilometers, and there are very few gas stations along the way. I made sure to fill up my car's tank to the brim before I started driving. Another important safety point is to fill tyres with nitrogen instead of air, as driving on concrete road heats up the tyres and so the air inside, leading to its expansion and many a times to tyre burst. After driving for an hour and a half at a speed of 90-110 kilometers per hour, I started to experience highway hypnosis. I noticed unintentionally speeding up, thanks to my audio setting of ""increased volume"" with ""increasing speed"". I decided to take a break at a gas station, but I didn't see any for the next 40 minutes. Finally, I saw an under-construction gas station and pulled over. I took a break and ate some snacks before continuing on my journey. Driving for more than 4-5hrs on such a highway makes one feel drowsy and so having chewing gum might help; so will a cup of tea/coffee after every one and half hours. Finally, after driving for around 7hrs we reached Aurangabad. As it was already well past the lunch time, we settled at the hotel for lunch and took a much needed break. We decided to visit Ellora caves the next morning. However, in the evening we decided to visit Biwi-ka-Maqwara: a Taj look-a-like started (in the memory of his queen) by the emperor Aurangzeb and finished by his son. Although a scaled down version of Taj Mahal, still it's an architectural marvel by any standard. Make a point to stay till the monument is lit up after the evening; it's an amazing sight. Next morning we drove to Ellora caves from Ginger Hotel: it's a drive of around 38km through winding lush green road. Being Sunday (and part of long weekend) there was heavy rush at Ellora. Although, we thought to take service of any ASI approved guide (bit costly : Rs 1800) but none were available, so bought a book from a hawker at the location (however, I would suggest to buy books published by credible sources). Ellora caves comprise of Buddhist (cave no.1-12), Hindu (13-29) and others are Jaina. On the centre , it is Kailasha Temple: monolithic rock cut temple, an architecture genius representing Hinduism. Situated on the extreme right (facing Kailasha Temple) are the oldest of the series of caves and these belong to Buddhism. Jaina caves are on the left side. If one is serious about history and architecture then the place would take not less than 8hrs to visit. Tips: The monument is close on Tuesday and best time to visit is July onwards (till March). Take an umbrella, if you visit during monsoon. Wear sports shoes so that it is easier to walk up and down the steps."
"We visited the place in first week Oct 22. It's a beautiful place to visit, especially during winters (preferably Oct-Feb). The tickets can be booked online or bought off the counter. The parking is a bit off from the gates (about 100m), so consider dropping off elders & kids at the gates. There are 34 caves, of which 28 can be visited walking. From 29 to 34, there's a e-vehicle service (Rs 32 per head) with good frequency & can be booked at the entrance. There are two types of Guides - ASI accredited and MTDC accredited. The latter charge 600/- & take you only till entrance of each cave (they aren't permitted to enter). ASI accredited guides charge 1800/- and can go inside (better to hire them, if interested in full details of the caves) Carrying water bottles & eatables allowed (at least none checked us) but can't eat inside the caves. Adequate tree cover is available for short breaks. No restaurant inside, but there are a number of eateries outside the gate, incl a MTDC restaurant. It takes not less than 4 hours to see all 34 caves properly, so ideal time to reach is by 9 AM. Don't forget to visit the Ghrushneshwar Mahadev temple at 1 km ahead of the caves."
"This is a most under rated UNEXO world heritage site. A must visit. If its in any other country, they would have reaped millions. On par with Ankor Vat, Pyramids and Machu Pichu."
It was very interesting place.Lots of interesting sculpture on the wall.Unbilivebl work.Many tempuras on the wall.
Kailash temple is one of the best places you can see if interested in architecture. The only example of cut out rock structure in the world. Class!
"We went on a road trip to Aurangabad from Pune and stopped over at Ellora caves. Really enjoyed the sculpture of this place. Don’t forget to hire an authorised guide to get a true walkthrough of this place, else you might miss out on the finer details."
"Ellora caves are very clean & beautiful. The Kailash temple is the highlight. Shows how three religions Buddhism, Jainism & Hinduism coexisted happily. Must visit!!!"
"Ellora is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India. It is one of the largest rock-cut monastery-temple cave complexes in the world, featuring Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monuments. There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which are open to public. These consist of 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12), 17 Hindu (caves 13–29) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves. It is 29 kilometres (18 miles) north-west of Aurangabad, and about 300 kilometres (190 miles) east-northeast of Mumbai. One can reserve a chauffeur-driven taxi / tourist taxi from Aurangabad which will charge around ?350-?400. There are numerous bus services running to Ellora from Aurangabad Central Bus Station, but the Maharashtra State Tourism Corporation (MTDC) Bus Service is most reliable. There is a luxury bus tour departing daily at 8AM from the MTDC office on Railway Station Road. In addition to Ellora, the tour also includes several famous sites in Aurangabad. Taxis of all types are available from Aurangabad. Daulatabad Fort is on the way to Ellora. Ellora Caves Timings: 9.00AM to 17.30PM closed on Tuesday, Open on ALL National Holidays.

Still Photography: Free, Video Photography: ?25 Every year in the third week of March, M T D C organizes the Ellora Festival of Classical Dance and Music at the caves."
Amazing I have visited 6out of 7 man made wonders of the world and this beats all of them hands down! A must see place! And too whoever decides on a wonder of the world sort it out!
"Visited Ellora Caves on a Sunday afternoon, reaching there at about 3pm. This was meant to be a quick visit to see the highlights as we had only a couple of hours before our flight. The architecture and sculptures of Ellora Caves is incredible. Kailash Temple (Cave 16) is beautiful and adorned with a plethora of intricate sculptures. But as it's the most popular site and situated at the entrance, it is overflowing with tourists. All the caves have their own charm. Caves 11 and 12 are Jain monasteries. I think it was 12 that was three levels high. We climbed up to the third level which was empty of people and serene with multiple columns and a pretty fantastic view of the countryside. Caves 1-16 are easily accessible on foot as they are cloistered together. But Caves 29, 32 etc require getting on a bus. This was unfortunate and we missed seeing them as we were told that the bus leaves every 30min. This seemed a very long interval for an important tourist site. We visited in October in the sweltering heat, so caps, umbrellas and sunglasses are life-saving. I strongly suggest slip-on shoes as you have to remove footwear at some of the caves. Touts at the site mar the experience. We were constantly harassed by sellers demanding that we buy their wares and self-proclaimed guides insisting that we employ them to show us around. Any attempt to dissuade these people resulted in more forceful negotitions. Finally, we realized that only by ignoring them would they leave us alone. I expect monsoon would be a wonderful time to visit because the river would be full and the hillsides would look even more lush. We could see a trickle near Cave 2 that would clearly be a waterfall in the monsoon. Winters would be cooler though. Several tiny restaurants and tourist gift shops are located at the entrance. The MTDC restaurant was closed though."
"Aurangabad : Ellora Caves Geography : The Ellora Caves are situated in Aurangabad District in central Maharashtra, India. It has a heavy Hyderabadi influence due to its connections with the Nizams of Hyderabad. Though famous initially for its handloom, today the world comes here to see the famed Caves at Ajanta & Ellora maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The Ellora Caves, a UNESCO World Heritage Centre, is one of the largest rock-cut monastery-temple cave complexes in the world - almost double the size of the Parthenon in Athens, and is situated around 28 Kms (17.5 Miles) of Aurangabad. History : It traces its history to the first millennium (550-950 AD) where they were excavated from the Western Ghats mountains for meditation and as a resting place for pilgrims. The excavation of the 100 odd caves had generous financing from wealthy disciples, traders and the rulers of the region. Of the 100 odd caves only 34 have significant carvings and are open to the Public. These are basically temple complexes carved out of the mountain. The temples cover three of the prominent religions of that era – Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The fact that they were built beside one another reflects the harmony between these religions at that time. The largest of the Hindu carvings is in Cave 16. It is the Kailasha Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world. What makes one wonderstruck is how it was carved as it was cut out of the mountain from top to bottom. The other 16 Hindu Caves too have Lord Shiva as the central theme but with carvings of other gods, especially the Dashaavtaar of Lord Vishnu in Cave 15. There is a water fall over Cave 49. The 12 Buddhist caves on the Southern side of the complex too have heavy carvings. 11 of them were designed as prayer halls with facilities for the monks to rest. Cave 10, also called the Vishvakarma Cave, is a large prayer hall with a 15-feet monolith statue of Lord Buddha at the middle. This chaitya is said to be the last rock-cut chaitya in India. The roof of this cave has been carved to resemble wooden beams. Many Buddhist Caves were deserted later and were then converted to Hindu Caves. A little apart from the Hindu and Buddhist Caves is the Jain caves. These caves are smaller than the Hindu & Buddhist caves but also feature highly detailed carvings. These 5 caves have Lord Mahaveera as the central deity and belonged to the Digambara sect of Jainism. Though five in number, they connected from inside, having more than one entrance. Emphasis is also given to the 24 Jenas and one can see many sacred carvings of Bahubali and Parsvanatha. One can still see remains of paintings on the roofs and walls and beside some of the statues. Many Hindu Gods and Goddesses too are depicted like Hanuman and Goddess Saraswati. Work on all the Caves seem to have stopped with the advance of the Islamic rulers from Delhi into the Deccan. Tourists : Aurangabad can be reached by flight, train and bus. There are regular city buses to Ellora for those who want to backpack. Private tour operators who run luxury buses also have package tours which include other local tourist sites like the Grishneshwar Jyotirlinga Temple near Ellora, The Tomb of Aurangzeb and the Bhadra Maruti Temple at Khultabad, the Daultabad Fort, Tomb of Aurangzeb's wife at Bibi Ka Maqbara, etc. The Government Transport Dept also runs an air-conditioned luxury bus daily at 8:30 hours from the Aurangabad Central Bus Stand as a package tour, bringing you back to town by evening. Tourist Cabs too are available from the city. Those planning to visit the Daulatabad Fort and go to the very top to see the two Cannons kept there, be prepared for a climb of over 850+ uneven steps, which is very tiring. There is a nominal entry fee for the Ellora Caves. As you enter you see the Hindu & Buddhist Caves and after that you can take the bus-shuttle to the Jain Caves around 4 Kms away. Most of the travel is in the open and so while travelling during summer months, it would be better to apply a liberal dose of sunscreen and carry wide brimmed hat and sunglasses to avoid getting sun burnt. Children may find this a bit tiring and of low interest. The annual Ellora Festival of Classical Dance and Music is held there in the third week of March."
"We went to Aurangabad in Aug 2018 for a 4 day trip. I contacted KM Holidays, Mangesh Kathar, via email, info@kmholidays.in asking for a quote for a car & driver for 4 days, allowing us to visit a range of places of Interest in and around Aurangabad. We spent 4/5 hours wondering around these caves, they are truly amazing, very well maintained, clean and tidy.The caves are Buddhist, Hindu and Jain, each individual. A must visit if you are staying in Aurangabad. August was a great time to wonder around, being out of season."
"This place is simply awe-inspiring. Located about 30 kms. from the city of Aurangabad, it is best to take a taxi for the day and visit these caves, the Daulatabad Fort on the way and in Aurangabad, Aurangzeb's Tomb & The Bibi ka Maqbara. All this would take a full day. You can keep a separate day for your visit to the Ajanta Caves (which would take a full day). Ellora is one of the largest Rock-cut temple-monastery in the world, and as I was told, Kailash Temple (#16) is a single monolithic rock cut masterpiece of excavation. This particular Cave itself could consume at least an hour if you wish. The Caves are divided into 3 sections: 1-12 are Buddhist Caves (Cave 10 & 12 are recommended) 13-29 are Hindu Caves (Cave 16 only is recommended) 30-34 are Jain Caves (Cave 32, 33 & 34 are recommended). You need to take their short paid bus ride from Cave 29 to these caves as they are around the hill on the other side. Do purchase the Ellora Ajanta Guide book (bargain the Rs.100 price down to Rs.50), go through this book briefly and then proceed. You do not need a guide unless you you are a student of archaeology wish to know in detail. Guides are expensive and start at Rs.1200, and can be bargained down to Rs.600. Each Cave has an information board and the Govt. appointed attendant would be happy to show and explain the nuances to you. You may like to offer him a small tip, but it is not at all mandatory. We were fortunate to have excellent weather as there was a very light feathery drizzle, and cloudy, so we did not have to face the heat."
"This is a must visit place for anyone who's interested in culture and Heritage. 'Ellora' is anglicised 'Verul'. I'll suggest spending at least one full day to appreciate the magnificence of the place. It's enough to say that it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site, featuring Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monuments, and artwork, dating from the 600-1000 CE period and it features the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world, the Kailas temple. Within driving distance are Devagiri Fort, Ajanta Caves and Lonar crater. Other close by places of interest are Bibi Ka Maqbara and Panchakki."
This is what the world comes to see in Aurangabad. Kailash temple in my opinion is a wonder of the world.Simply breathtaking.
"Stunning caves, would recommend starting with the Jain temples from 32 then working your way back to front with the highlight at 16. You can take a bus to 32 from entrance. We spent a best part of 4 hours here took our time definitely need plenty of water and good walking shoes, it was 40C. There are plenty of guides to choose from official ones who charge 1400 rupees to others for 400, better to do a bit of reading up before you go to really appreciate it"
"The caves are very beautiful and a must see if in Aurangabad. Entrance for foreigners is 500inr. To get there, take a local red bus from Aurangabad CBS to Ellora for 33inr one way. The staff at the bus station will point you to the right bus."
"Got an opportunity to visit this site few days back. Once you enter the site, you are greeted by nicely maintained garden. At entry itself, you enter cave no 16 which is the best among 32 caves Ellora has. This cave is absolute marvel of craftsmanship. Carved out of single rock, it presents delicately intricate carvings. At few places, you see the original color as well. Just wondering what glory it would have showcased when newly constructed. Cave 16 also has Shiva Mandir where you see large shivlinga in a massive temple. From other caves, the to mention few are cave 4 and 10. Caves 1 to 15 are dedicated to Gautama Buddha where you see beautiful statues of lord Buddha. Cave 17 to 32 are dedicated to hindu gods. The story goes that it took almost 200 years to complete these caves and generations of kingdom devoted their time and resources to complete this grand marvel. One needs at least 2-3 hours to see all the caves. I was also glad to see government efforts to maintain this heritage site."
"These are not as good as Ajanta, but worth seeing nevertheless. If you are visiting them after seeing Ajanta - then you can skip the Buddhist caves and focus on the Hindu and the Jain caves. Should take a guide. Spend more time in Cave 16. An hour's drive from Aurangabad."
"Ellora caves are a must visit in ones lifetime. That these are in our own country, makes it easier and cheaper for us. The caves are located 29 Kms from Aurangabad and near the Grishneshwar temple. Ellora caves are UNESCO World Heritage site and guarded by CCTVs, police and security men/women. There are over 100 caves, of which about 34 are open to public.They say it is best viewed in the evening hours, when the sun casts its golden hue over the stones. It is better to wear walking shoes and light clothes. Carry plenty of water. After buying the entrance ticket, turn right and start from Cave No1. Caves 1 to 12 are Buddhist and show Buddha in the preaching pose. Cave No 6 and 10 are important. The Hindu caves are from No 13 to 29. The highlight is cave No 16 which is the Kailas temple, believed to have been carved out of a single rock from Top to the Base. It is the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world. Imagine, the brilliant imagination,craftsmanship and planning this would have required. It is calculated that more than 400000 tons of rock was carved out to create this marvellous temple, in the form of a chariot.It has a gateway, an assembly hall, a multi storey main temple, surrounded by numerous shrines. The walls of the main temple have carving depicting scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata. There is a big Shivlinga in the main temple, which gets the setting suns rays.This cave itself would require at least 2 hours to fully appreciate the beauty. Cave No 30-34 house the Jain history, with paintings and idols of the teerthankaras. As with many of our other heritage temples, the idols and carvings have been defaced by the marauding muslim army. It is said that aurangzeb had stationed 1000 soldiers for 6 months to destroy this site, but they could not completely destroy the place. Despite the damage, what remains, makes one wonder just how magnificent this would have been during the period 600 - 1000 CE, when these were made."
"What is most striking about these magnificient caves is the thought process that went into excavation of these majestic structures, Standing in front of these you simply feel so, so proud of being a part of such awesome heritage. The main Buddha cave, numbered as 12, is simply breathtaking. Then there is the largest monolithic structure in the world, cave number 16, THE Kailash temple, which simply leaves you spell bound. These caves open at 6 AM and remain opne till 6 PM, I would urge you to go a little early to enjoy the early morning sojourn and also avoid the heat. Monsoons might be wonderful as there are little waterfalls dotted on the Buddha caves. It would be great if you can take a guide - the govt guides have fixed rate of 1378 rupees while the local ones charge around 600 - both stay on till almost 2- 3 hours of the entire trip - yes the area is that huge - 3 km radius - and there is a bus to take you to the Jain caves"
"In my opinion these caves are better then Ajanta!! They are so diverse and lot off them. 500 rupees each but you can seen hours here. I've been in India for about 3 weeks and everyone wants to take a selfie with you, which I don't mind I've always said yes. But at Ellora be aware as soon as you say yes to 1 person in a busy crowd everyone comes flocking over. At one point I was surrounded by roughly 30 people wanting selfies so if probably advise just say no when your here. But a huge must see these caves are gorgeous they are breathtakingly amazing"
"I just visited the Ellora Caves, along with Kailash Temple, and I am absolutely astounded by what I have witnessed here! I have been to my share of remarkable places in this world, and this honestly ranks right up there with the very best of them (think pyramids of Giza, Taj Mahal, etc). Wow! The Ellora Caves are many, and some of them aren't so much more than a boxy cavern chipped out of rock, but the ones that were done with care and attention to detail are mind-blowing! There are some remarkable Buddhist and Jain caves here, but Kailash Temple (Hindu) takes the cake! It is massive. Your photos won't begin to do it justice. When you go home to your friends and show them your slideshow, you'll be trying in vain to explain how much more tremendously huge and mind-boggling and spectacular it really was when you were there... and you'll know that they just won't get it until they visit too. So that's what I have to say to you! Go see them for yourself! You'll be glad you did!"
"We visited both the Ellora and Ajanta caves on different days (would not recommend doing them on the same day). We saw the Ellora caves first and were blown out of the water by them. But we were equally so with the Ajanta for different reasons. The Ajanta caves have a stunning setting in a crescent shaped canyon with an amazing viewpoint. The Ellora caves have more variety in that they have Hindu, Buddhist and Jain inspired caves where Ajanta is only Buddhist. Both are worth the visit and these caves were the highlight of our two month India trip! The key is to go early to avoid the crowds and heat (and avoid weekends and holidays). Keep in mind each cave is closed one day of the week. We arrived at Ellora at 8:30am but I think we might have been able to come earlier. Once there we started at cave 16 which is a main attraction. We spent a good hour both going up above the temple (there is a path to the right of the entrance that we were shown by a guard, for a price) and the massive interior. It was worth it as the views down on the temple were fabulous. We then went to the right to the Buddhist caves. In hindsight I would have done it differently by taking the bus out to the Jain caves next and then walking back to cave 29 and others before it got too hot and then back to the Buddhist caves which are all together and close to the entrance. I won't go into detail about the caves as you should read up on your own or hire a guide. I would recommend a guide if you don't know anything about India, their myths, religion, etc. We wanted the freedom to explore all the caves. Often the guides bypass some caves as being uninteresting or similar to others. There are definitely some caves that are more popular than others but we found each cave to have something to offer. Those not as crowded were very peaceful. We opted to hire a car/driver which is preferable if you have the money."
"Definitely visit the kailash structure, it is an incredibly amazing architectural wonder! The Buddhist caves are ok( Ajanta is better ). Visit the Jain caves (30-34), there is a bus service that takes you to those. Cave no. 29 is on the way which is also dedicated to Lord Shiva. Note that Ajanta and Ellora are closed one day a week, make your plans based on that"
"Ellora Caves are located around 30 Kms from Aurangabad, in Maharashtra State.Though 34 caves are open to public, out of over 100 caves, the main attraction lies in Cave 16. As we reach the caves, we first come across Cave 16 which features the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world, the Kailasha temple, a chariot shaped monument dedicated to Shiva. Once, the caves served as Monasteries for Monks, temples for prayers and a place for pilgrims to rest, but presently it is an ""UNESCO World Heritage Site"". We should be proud of the same. We visited this Ellora Caves on 7th January 2017 and we mostly spent our time in Cave 16 only. It took more than 2 hours for us and hence we could not see the other caves. But what ever we visited, its worth and informative and enjoyable."
"Easily accessible Unesco world heritage site in India. Located at around 20km distance from Aurangabad. Accessible by road from Aurangabad by cab/ auto /bus. Autos charge 400-450rs. 1.For an average traveller, it takes 3-4 hrs to finish off. Art lovers and history buffs will have a feast and need more time. 2. Once you are inside, no food or water available, so carry along with you. 3. Wear comfortable clothing and comfortable and easily removable footwear. Few caves require you to remove footwear. 4. Take a guide or in the least buy the guide book. The care takers and workers offer to guide individual caves for a sum of 50-100. Even if they don't know history properly, they know what to see in the cave. 5. You need to take a bus (from entrance) for caves 29-34. 6. They open very early (6am), go early to avoid sun and crowd. 7. Plenty of reasonable and tasty local food options outside the caves and they open by 7am. 8. Grishneshwar temple is pretty close."
Words escape this amazing history and how pristine the condition of these caves have been kept all of these years. What a find!!! I loved every minute of this visit to these amazing caves.
These caves are not just sculptures but represent the expressiveness and depth of human mind. Your visit begins at Cave 16 which is the most recognized and referred. The entire concept of sculpting rock from top to bottom is mind blowing and you are amazed at the magnitude of work which happened long long back which took place over 100 years. The execution of work is impressive and each sculpture has a story and you realize the expressions and body gestures as to how much work the artists did. Tips: - Dont move without an official guide. - Do give yourself ample time to soak in the glory. - Carry your water. The nearby Kailas hotel has good food and washroom facilities. DONT MISS TO VISIT THE ELLORA TOURIST CENTRE. Its just adjacent to parking bay. Better start from here and then proceed to see the caves.
"The caves display old 6th-10th centruy carvings. the main attraction is cave 16 which is a gem of an example of a cut out cave. The group of caves also are an excellent example of religious harmony as seen by the support provided by kings to Hindu, Buddhist and Jain monks who did these carvings over many generations."
"We visited by car/driver arranged by our hotel($25-pickup at 11:30AM, arrival at caves by 1PM, then airport drop at 5:30PM). The highway is newly paved but the traffic is the normal horrible; bikes and tuk tuks. From the road, we walked 150m to the entrance($8-foreignor), then the feature Cave #16 (Kailasha temple) is 100m directly in front. After 30 minute visit, we walked 1/2km south to visit selected caves(#15, #12, #10, #5, and #2), then returned 1/2km to the front of Cave #16. Here we boarded a bus(small payment) for 2km north to Caves #29, #31, and #32, then returned by bus. Passing the entrance at 4PM, we noted a queue of ~200 local youths. At the road junction, tourists were feeding a large family of peaceful Gray Langurs. We were pleased to visit in the afternoon as the caves face west and good pictures need the extra light. Wonderful but tiring day."
"For those who have visited Ajanta I would suggest you start with cave 16. The caves 1 through 15 showcase the Buddhism monarchy, after that it's Hinduism and Jainism artifacts. The cave 16 is the center piece carved into the mountain. Take the bus from the MTDC parking and start from Cave 32 and down to 16. For couples with kids: there is a lot of walk and it's suggested you carry good amount of water and some energy bars. It's a walkable distance and I don't think strollers would be of good help. If you are staying in Aurangabad then I would suggest you do the Daulatabad fort (see my reviews for the same). It's 15 minutes from Daulatabad fort and 40 min from Aurangabad. It's not well maintained as you would experience in Ajanta but it's architecture is different then that of Ajanta. They have their own identity. Allow yourself at least 3 hours to complete the tour with a normal pace."
Take at least 4 hrs to see all the places. A very nice place with rich indian history. Guide is not needed if u have some knowledge about indian history. You can buy a guide book but remember one thing bargain with the seller they will tell you an absurd price for anything. Cave 16 is main attraction but it is advisible to visit all the caves.
Not too many travellers visit Ellora as its quite a journey to get there. We got the train to Aurangabad from Mumbai and then drove to Ellora. It was well worth it. Buying tickets was chaotic. We weren't really sure if there was a queue but after half an hour we made our way to the front of a huddle to buy our tickets. We didn't pay for a guide but did buy a guide book. We preferred to wander around by ourselves. The caves themselves are magnificent. Spread over a couple of kilometers but not too arduous. There is a bus that runs between the entrance and the most distance caves but we walked it instead and it was fine. We were the center of attention frequently at the caves because I don't think there are many European tourists. We were stopped several times and asked for photos! There is a restaurant on site - we didn't eat there but it sold the usual indian fare. There are toilets on site but only near the entrance. We allowed 3 - 4 hours and saw all the caves.
"Ellora Caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Built during 600 to 1000 CE, Ellora Caves lie in the Sahyadri hills in Aurangabad and is a 40 minutes drive from the Aurangabad. The Ellora Caves comprise Hindu, Buddhist and Jain temples and over a 100 caves with only 34 open to the public excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandari hills. Cave 16 or Kailasha temple - a monument dedicated to Shiva is the largest single monolithic rock excavated in the world. It was built during 757-783 AD by Krishna I. Carved out of a single rock, this temple is one of its kind in the world. Dedicated to Shiva, the temple is based on Shiva’s abode - Mt Kailash. It comprises the typical features of a Hindu temple. Ellora Caves opening hours are sunrise to sunset. The timings for Ellora Caves are 8 in the morning till 5.30 in the evening. Ellora Caves are closed on Tuesdays. The caves can be visited during rest of the week. The best time to visit Ellora Caves is during November to March. Situated almost 27 km from Aurangabad city, Ellora Caves can be reached easily via buses and taxis. There are private taxi stands in Aurangabad which offer a trip to the caves and back starting at Rs 1,000 depending on the car type."
The ticket queue was very long. Online ticket booking was not possible due to mobile network issue. Even ticket counters were only one or two. Visitors were in thousands.
Good to see. Video filming is separate cost. Mobile phones allowed Entrance 40 rs. Till 15 years age is free of cost.
"Very nice place, Monday closed, go early mornings, take Torch compulsory as mobile flash light can not be used, watch cave paintings carefully , from Aurangabad road is under construction to needs 3 hours to reach."
"this is a huge cave(actually a group of 34 caves)wherein you will have to drive from 1cave to other,we went in October,still it was too hot,walking down every cave was difficult.wish there was rain for sometime,it would have been great.it will take 3-4hours to see every cave,we didn't hire any guide,but the people who did-they were giving detailed info about the sculptures. stunned to see the size of huge structures of the caves.people traveling by own vehicle can travel easily by themselves, others can hire auto rickshaws, which charge a huge buck."
"If you're coming to Aurangabad, of course, you're coming for Ajanta and Ellora. These are two stops in all of India that really are 'must see' if you are interested in history and archeology. Ellora is about 45 minutes drive from Aurangabad and you can there a number of ways and most hotels will offer to book you a private car, which will be the most expensive solution. Tuk-tuks will go there and back - and wait for you - for as little as Rs500 if you drive a real hard bargain, but the drivers will start adding on all sorts of side trips and detours to get you up to spending Rs700-800. There is also a public bus that leaves from the city centre, but that can be tricky. Nothing in the bus station is in English at all and the chaos of Indians leaping onto busses before they've even pulled in to the loading bay means you almost certainly won't get a seat. When you arrive at Ellora, there's a Rs10 'tax' to pay and then the Rs250 entrance fee. Head up to the far right to begin your tour at cave 1, or cave 2 since cave 1 is actually empty. You'll then work your way back to the centre and the highlight of the entire visit, cave 16. Some of the caves look very uninteresting from the outside. I don't recall the numbers, but they look like they were machine cut and made of poured concrete quite recently. Don't let that stop you going inside The site has put in a lot to make it safe and tourist friendly and the most uninteresting facades actually house the best carvings, on multiple floors. I tried to get there very early and it appeared I was the only non-Indian tourist in the entire complex. Indian families were rushing around at high speed, barely taking anything in and posing for family photos. You will have to be patient and wait for every member of the family to have their picture taken in turn. Patience is definitely required to get the shots you want. None of the caves have any lighting at all. This can be tricky when you're climbing stairs, but otherwise, the only challenge is lighting your photos for the best result. After you've visited cave 16, the amazing temple at the heart of the site, head to the far left to explore caves 17-29. As of August 2015, cave 29 is inacessible along this route, so you'll need to plan a short detour. This side of the site isn't quite as breathtaking, but there's still a lot to see. Caves 30-34 are a short drive (or walk if you have the stamnia) and your driver can then take you to cave 29 for the final stop. There are some really unpleasant toilets on site which require Rs5 to use and don't expect to find any soap or toilet paper. They are located near temply 16, down a short hill. Ellora is simply stunning and worth all the time. It can be very hot and the climbing really did wear me out in a way I wasn't expecting. Everything is accessed on foot and requires climbing, so this wonderous area simply isn't possible for anyone with walking challenges."
"the caves are massive and you may not be able to cover all. But if you do then ask for Vijay Jaiswal at the ticket office. He was our guide and he really brings the story behind the caves alive! he will cover only three caves - 16, 9 and 32 and you can cover the rest by yourself. But the passion that he brings to his work is great and makes your experience so much better"
"This is one of the most amazing places I have ever visited. I was traveling alone, but felt very safe and comfortable at the caves. I was often approached by families, asking where I was from and whether I would mind if they took my picture. Unlike Ajunta, there aren't many hawkers trying to sell you souvenirs or take you on a guided tour, so you can just explore the caves at your own pace and savor it all."
"Unlike the Ajanta caves, the Ellora caves were never ""lost"". We went one Jain temple, a Buddhist vihara and a Buddhist chaitya. We finished off by going to a Hindu temple, which is the biggest monolithic monument in the world. There were some paintings but the key attraction was the monolithic temples. They are just awesome and are must sees if you are planning a trip to India. It is well worth the time of going to Aurangabad. I highly recommend my guide, Amod Basole. He is very knowledgeable, smart, and can speak good English."
"The biggest temple made by one stone was really amazing, and statues and sculptures were also cool and nice. unfortunately some people seems local climbed upon statues or historical things, that was disappointing as we can see everywhere in India. Others were not so surprising, I recommend people to go there prior to Ajanta because Ajanta is more attractive and beautiful, even though Ellora is powerful and nice."
"I was amazed to see the beauty of the sculptures across the 34 caves and the effort that would have gone in those times to create this. A must visit especially for people who are interested in history, art and architecture. Given that there is a plethora of information available on the caves as well as feedback from others, I would like to focus my review on some tips: 1. Get in early by around 7.30 am / 8 am - there is less number of visitors at this time 2. Better to visit post the monsoon season - say Sep until Feb. I went in March and it was very hot. 3. Avoid buying any books / artefacts around this place - I noticed the sellers were attempting to sell guide books that were not worth more than Rs 100, to international visitors for more than Rs 1000. I have looked at these books and not worth a purchase. There is enough literature available on the internet. 4. You can take your vehicle to see the caves #24 onwards - if you are not enthusiastic about walking 1.5 - 2 kms. Avoid taking the autos within the place - they demand a huge price which is not worth it 5. Take a torch, lots of water, short eats and some comfortable footwear. If you can start early from Aurangabad city (it takes you about 30 - 40 mins to get to Ellora Caves), you can spend about 4 - 5 hours at this place. You can visit the other attractions i.e., Daulatabad Fort, Tomb of Aurangazeb and Bibi ka Maqbara on your way back to the city. Avoid combining visit to Ellora and Ajanta caves on one day - it involves a lot of travel and you will not be able to spend quality time at either place."
"The Ellora Caves are one of the Unesco World Heritage sites in India. It is a must visit place in india. Some of the caves in the far ends are poorly maintained but most of it are still intact. Plan your visit as early as possible and try to cover all the caves by Noon as it gets hot in the afternoons. You can drive you vehicles for most of the caves. For Caves 1-14 gotta park it in near the Main parking. Best time to visit is August to December, when the climate is not very hot. The June - July Monsoon time is best if you wanna see the real Beauty of the caves with the water falls all around."
"You can see a lot of pictures of Ellora Caves on the website but to see them in person is awesome. The art, the work is just so beautiful that you would wonder how this was done Centuries ago. Dating way back to 2 BC or so."
"With 18kms away from Aurangabad the caves took me back to history where in my school days i have read about. An architecture brilliance depicting Buddhism, Jainism and also Hinduism. Though some of the paintings and sculptures are not that clear the authorities are trying reasonably good to restore them. The great kailash temple is a must visit cave and the sculptures depicting shiva and parvati together dancing and playing dice are worth the whole trip. The budhist caves with the stupa is marvelous"
"Ellora is close to 33 kms from Aurangabad and roads are quite bad. It take little more than an hour to reach Ellora. These caves are spread across but one can reach these different complexes by car (entry ticket is Rs.10 for Indian but higher for foreign visitors). Cave no 1 to 12 are devoted to Buddhism; 13 to 29 to Hinduism and 30 to 34 to Jainism. As you enter, you could see cave.16, the Kailasha temple, an example how great the Indian sculptors have been. It is suggested you walk to extreme right and start with cave 1. First 5 caves (1 to 5), gives you an idea how difficult it was to create these caves and the era of using sunlight alone for everything can be evidenced. The most important cave in the Buddhist set is cave 10. The grand pillars and the acoustic brilliance of this cave is just more than amazing. There is a big Buddha statue and one can feel great vibrations in this cave. The echoes of ""Om"" just resonate for few seconds and is a must-feel experience. This is 2-storeyed cave and one may want to spend close to 30 minutes in this cave. Caves 11 and 12 are multi-storeyed and one can imagine how they had designed the roofs, flooring and pillars in multi-storyed caves so many decades back. Cave-15 is known as Dasavathara cave and the sculptures of dasavatharam is seen with amazing piece of brilliance and expressions in first floor of this cave. There is big nandi as well, which had lost its legs, pedestal and horns, thanks to the demolitions across years. Cave-16 is the Kailasha temple - a monolithic rock cut temple, which excavated from top to bottom. They say that this cave was excavated and sculpted by ten generations of people across 200 years. The 2 giant pillars standing alone and elephants are great to see. This cave also had 3-D carvings of Yaksha hanging from the ceiling, which is very rare. This also has some paintings, which is not so common in Ellora caves. We can see three gopuras behind, couple of them unfinished and one is finished. Cave 29 was also a massive piece of history and has enormous sculptures. The height from which the cave has been sculpted is more than amazing and this cave has various chambers. Caves 31-34 of Jainism are located around 1 km from the rest of the caves and advised to reach out by car. There are small eateries near this set of caves. This caves has some great monolithic sculptures. This is two-storeyed. One gets to enter into cave 33 and gets to cover all 4 caves together. Ellora caves are closed on Tuesdays. It takes close to 5-6 hours if one wants to visit all the caves. If you want to spend time only at important caves and rush through the rest of them, 4 hours should be more than sufficient. Important to note: There are no great hotels or restaurants to eat. There are no toilets too as you go across caves. Carry enough water, snacks, biscuits and may be chocolates too. Carry sunglass, caps and some good slip-ons/shoes (to avoid your legs getting hurt). Also, carry a torch with you as the caves would be dark in some places."
"absolutely fantastic carvings and a huge temple carved right out of a cliff. located close to aurangabad (compared to ajanta), this is much easier to travel to. just like ajanta, keep in mind that many of the caves are plain dwelling places or monasteries. there were quite a few folks walking in and out of the caves in a jiffy - with a price-less look of having expected to see a taj mahal, but being greeted by a dark a bat infested cave with just some holes cut in the walls for monks to meditate."
"They are beautiful and worth a visit, which is why you are looking at the reviews! I'll try and give you a bit of info I couldn't find. If you are staying in Aurangabad, Ellora are about 30km away and takes about 45 minutes, Ajanta are 100 km. it is 250 rupees to get in. Take plenty of water and wear good shoes as there is lots of climbing but just uneven staircases not heart attack inducing heights! Save cave 16 for last......trust me. There is restaurant on site, it is good value and has lovely owners and the food is delicious, try the butter fry dal. You don't need a guide, just walk at your own pace. A driver will cost between 1200 and 1600 for the day, depending on whether you book independently or through your hotel. Hope that helps"
"The rock cut shrines of Ellora in Maharashtra are magnificent artistic creations, carved between the fifth and thirteenth century. These caves with diverse details and minute carvings, representing three different faiths, Buddhist, Brahmanical & Jaina are excellent examples of Indian art.The wealth of sculptures here is both of aesthetic interest as well as iconographic importance. It was probably the incredible scenic beatuty of the place which induced the Jainas of ancient times to name the hill on which the caves are excavated as Charanadri, that is, the hill of the Charanas, the denizens of celestial regions. Ellora is about 29 kms to the north west of Aurangabad and takes you approx 40 mts to reach by car. Ellora is also called Verul and Elura and it is the corrupt form of the ancient name Elapura. The caves of Ellora run approximately 2 kmin the north-south direction. At the southern end are the twelve Buddhist caves while in the north are the six Jaina caves. In between are seventeen Brahmanical caves. Apart from this there are unnumbered caves of the Ganesha lena group and the Jageswari group, several of which have local names. I would recommend visiting all the caves which can take well over 4 hrs depending on your interests levels, but at the minimum one must visit cave nos 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 21, 29, 30, 30A, 31, 32, 33 and 34. Cave 34 to 30 needs to be visited first and one needs to go by car, and similarly cave 29 also is far from the other groups and needs to be accessed by car after seeing 34 - 30. There is a beautiful walking path from cave 29 to cave 28 underneath a waterfall, but the access is closed due to repairs. The view of the access path itself is very beautiful from cave no 28 which is on the opposite side. I will strongly recommend taking a guide which will cost INR 1000 for the entire 34 caves and only for cave 16 the price is INR 500 since cave 16 is in itself a historical wonder which needs explaining and understanding. Maintain silence, leave your footwear outside where indicated, no use of flash photography. Ellora caves is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Start early before the sun is up, and the crowd gets in to have a peaceful and wonderful viewing. We hope you enjoy."
"I know you can read lot of about Ellora caves on google but here I tell you my experience. I already planned to visit Ellora caves, Grishnehwar, Bhadra Maruti temple in one day while I was returning from Trimbakeshwar to Pune. So I started with Grishneshwar and after I reached Ellora caves. As soon we reached there, one auto person came to us and asked that he can guide and show us main main 6 caves as in one day it is not possible to cover all 34 caves. We went there first time so was not aware of that place. We settled down in 250 rs for visiting main important 6 caves. As soon we reached the last cave number 16 known as Kailasha Temple also, we were so tired and feel that it was worth to visit only and only this main cave. Because architecture is almost same in all the caves. As per me the most beautiful cave is the main no 16. It is hard to believe that before 1800 years ago men dig out one single mountain to acheieve these wonders. No need to take any guide. All history is mentioned on a board outside the cave."
"I'm writing from the perspective of having visited each of the Aurungabad, Ajanta, and Ellora caves. I visited in July during the monsoon season which is the low season for this tourist area. If you had to visit one go to the Ellora caves. It's bigger, more beautiful and has work from three different religions in one place. The Ajanta caves are beautiful in their own right, but the amount of work put in is evident in the monuments and sculptures of Ellora -- so extraordinary. Really, really beautiful with a lot of history. I really would hire one of the official licensed guides at Ellora. There's just too many carvings and symbolism in the caves to go without one. Walking through these temples with someone knowledgeable is the difference between ""oh cool statue I guess"" to ""oh wow I had no idea"". For example, in one of the Buddhist caves, my guide pointed out the acoustics of the temple i.e. good for praying and chanting. We were alone in the cave and he sang a slow Buddhist chant (he's Hindu!) and the reverberations in the cave were really special. It was a very surreal moment. You could use a guide book with some history on the caves, but it's just not the same as talking to someone who is a practicing Hindu. The best time to visit is indeed during the monsoon season as the trees and grass around this area are totally green and lush. The caves are largely empty of other people which make the temples even more majestic. Even my guide mentioned hating giving tours during November, December (high season) because of the crowd and noise."
"The Ellora caves are known for temples and monasteries, excavated out of a hill. It is 26 km from Aurangabad. There are total 34 caves. Cave number 16 (Kailasha Temple) is most beautifull. Other worth seeing caves are Buddist caves (caves 1 to 12), Jain Caves (caves 30 to 34) , and Hindu caves (Caves 13 to 29) where mostly Lord Shive is depicted. Ellora caves are a World Heritage Site, and a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India . Tourits shuld stay at Aurangabad and take Daily tours to Ellora from Aurangabad. It is a most impressive place which is a must visit. One can add visit to Ghrishneshwar Jyotirlinga inthe vicinity of the caves, Daulatabad fort on the way to Aurangabad, Bibi ka Maqbara, and other nearby sights."
This are all mixed cave of budtha and hindu religions...most beautiful cave is cave #14 its huge with lord shiva ling temple surronded by hindu god and goddess. Temple is beautifully carved with elephant all around and you can see Mahabharata on left wall. Many status are broken but its okey..!! Cave no 10 and 12 are for lord budha and they are really quit and peaceful..!! When I was there caring and renovation was going on..!! Before leaving dont forgot to feed graps to monkeys...have fun..
"These ""caves"" are really temples carved into rock. We still can't quite imagine how they were created. An ancient civilization found a massive collection of bedrock, and carved inward, leaving columns, pillars, Buddha statues, inner chambers... it is just unreal. If you look closely, you can see the individual scrapes left by the hand chisels that created it, giving some sense of the hard manual labor that left these temples. Many of the temples require you to take off your shoes. If you don't want to run the risk of getting a little bat urine on your feet, bring thick socks. These caves can be dark, so consider a flashlight if you want a closer look, but because of the paintings, some docents do not allow flashlights or flash photography. There are squat-toilets at the site. Bring your own toilet paper and hand sanitizer, as usual. Plan on at least 3-4 hours, or more time if you can, to take in all of the caves. It really is worth wandering into at least 1/2 of them, although most of them are fairly similar in basic design and carving/painting. Bring snacks, as there are no restaurants at this site. Very few benches, not wheelchair or handicapped accessible, lots of walking up/down and around things. Very fun to wander, as most things are open. Keep an eye on smaller kids, as very few high places have any kind of guard rails. We took the local bus from Aurangabad, which was fine, but harder to catch the bus BACK to the city. Make sure that you leave enough time so that its still daylight when you're trying to catch the return bus ride. You can also arrange for your own driver through any hotel/hostel (more expensive, but much more convenient)."
"My wife and I had driven to the Ajanta and Ellora caves last month. We stayed a night at Jalgaon, went to Ajanta and in the afternoon drove to Aurangabad so as to be close to the Ellora caves. We stayed at the Manor which was clean and adequate for an overninght stay and had a superb out door Punjabi restaurant where we had dinner. The weather was really cool and nice and it was a very pleasant experience. The next morning we had breakfast and then headed out. 1st stop was the Bibi ka Makbara and after that we headed for the Ellora caves, The caves are quite close to the city ( about 30 km from our hotel ) and we reached fairly early before the crowds arrived. We did not take a guide and so after parking our car started by seeing the closest cave which was lucky because we started off at cave 16 or Kailasha which is the largest and most impressive of all the caves. The guide book that I read subsequently captured the enormity of the task accomplished 1200 years ago in this sentance "" It is estimated that the task of quarrying its 3,000,000 cubic feet of rock must have occupied at least one hundred years"". In case you are wondering, I just cross checked the number of 0's and there is no mistake. Its hard to imagine how without any modern equipment and design software such a large and intricate temple could be carved out from a mountain starting from the top and proceeding downward. If someone were to blindfold you and take you into the courtyard of the temple, it would be impossible for anyone to tell that you were inside a cave carved out of a single mountain. Not only is the extent of work mind blowing, but also when you consider that in a monolithic structure there was little or no scope for error and no computers to generate blueprints for the army of artisans to use. The carvings in this cave-temple are also of very high artistic quality. The sculpture of ""Ravana shaking Kailasha"" is beautiful and the intricate details truly spectacular. We spent about half an hour in this cave and then came out and walked along the road to cave no 1 , seeing the caves along the way. Tourists are advised to avoid the auto drivers who offer to take you to all the caves. Most of the caves are located one after the other in close proximity and one is allowed to take ones car from the car park and drive to where the Jain caves are located one and half kms further . There is also a fairly nice waterfall ( plus the smaller one that you pass on your way to cave No. 1 ) . Overall we took about 4 hours to see all the caves, and so had to drop the plan of visiting the Daulatabad fort on our way back ( its located on the road between Aurangabad city and the Ellora caves) as we had planned only one nights stay in Aurangabad and so had to drive about 300 km to Solapur where we had already booked a nights stay on our way back to Bangalore."
Kailash Temple will make you simply speechless. Hard to describe in in words. Good tourist facilities. Requires a certified guide. You need at least 5-6 hours to properly visit the site. Avoid the hot afternoon.Early morning or after 2 pm is best. Winter is the best time.
"We visited ellora caves during our short trip to Aurangabad in early August. Having reached the caves around 4 in the evening, we had lesser time to see all the caves (the place is closed by 6 pm). There are 34 caves and a lot of walking is involved. We visited the main caves as suggested by our guide. Yes, a hiring a guide was really helpful as we were able to appreciate the architecture n importance of the place better. The place is really amazing, very quite and well maintained. Must go with your camera and a comfortable pair of shoes for the long walks!!"
"Do this in one day. We hired a car for the day which was an easy and cheap way for my family and I to get there and move between caves. They are pretty spread out so transport is a bonus. Great day out and plenty of shade in which to rest. Ice cream sellers and cold drinks at the start, which were fair price and cold. No hassle at all from sellers, all very polite and not at all bothersome."
"Visited the caves on 23 June(Sunday).As soon as I reached there, was pretty disturbed by the loud noises produced by hundreds of College going kids and children.This was unlike Ajantha which was far quieter.There were plenty of people,quiet oblivious to the sacred nature of the surroundings ,unknown to the hard work and dedication of the sculptors, photographing themselves with Sculptures of Lord Shiva and few had even huddled up with Ravana. Anyway felt very sad at the lack of understanding of our scriptures and holy books by the new generation. Anyways coming back to the caves, I tried for a guide and soon a guide joined us @rs 750. The cave Called Kailash Cave (Number 16) is probably the biggest cave and I would have missed a lot but for the presence of the Guide.We went through Sculptors depicting Ramayana(South side) and Mahabharat (North side).There were also stories about Ravana. Many forms of Lord Shiva were depicted very well. Saw one the beautifully made Buddhist Cave learned about Mahayana and Vajrayana forms. The holy words""Buddhan saranam Gacchami......when recited inside the cave,could be seen reverberating and filling the whole place with such purity and making the atmosphere Divine.I could even feel the Presence of Lord Buddha in the place.It seemed that I had traveled back to history. We also visited Jain caves and were explained about 24 Jain tirthankars and the sects namely shvetambaras and Digambaras. Left the place with a very good feeling and great appreciation for the great sculptors who gave their entire life towards making of such beautiful sculptors"
"I visited India about three months ago in March with my husband . During this trip I visited Ellora and Ajanta caves . what a amazing places those were. i was just blank when i saw those awosome milestone pieces of art. i advice you if you're visiting India you must visit Ajanta and Ellora at once in a lifetime. if you don't see Ajanta , Ellora you don't see anything in India. there was a temple of Lord Shiva , where we went and feel the satisfaction about the life . in short just amazing , and i can't describe it in words"
"This is a must see place if you are visiting India/Maharashtra. The kailasanathar temple is so incredible that there are simply no words to describe it. I just din't want to leave that place. It was so grand. My jaw dropped when i saw that temple. I have seen Mahabalipuram temples which are similar to Ellora caves, carved out of single rock, but Kailasanathar temple is one beauty which can not be compared to any other architecture. It is simply wonderful. Best way to visit Ellora is to take a cab from Aurangabad. Visited in Jan 2011 with family."
Ellora caves are spread out unline Ajanta. The hindu and the Buddhist caves are still in one stretch but the jain caves are a different patch. One needs to move around from one chunk of caves to another by car. All caves are different though most of the sculptures are repetitive after a while. Pick up the ASI booklets available for guidance and if you do not want to hop in and hop out of all the caves do only the ones recommended by ASI. The caves are well maintained and local guides are available who run their torch through a few forgotten paintings and tell stories not in the books and not known. Not necessary to take a guide. One can see on ones own also. It is a marvel of art and architecture. Food and water is available close to every cluster of caves.
Ellora caves need atleast a half day tour.The caves are in a remote area so it is very hard to get many eateries available.So u have the option of carrying ur packed lunch from Aurangabad or enjoy ur lunch at Ellora restaurant.Although the food is a bit oily but acceptable n digestable.The price of the meal is moderate but not very suitable for the international travellers who abstain from oily food.
"A beautiful place, gaining knowledge about three different religions. The guides could do much better. The caves , especially cave no. 16 and the two Jain caves, need to be cleaned. It was stinking due to the bats."
"Ellora caves are very smaller than Ajanta caves in every aspects... but sculptures there, are also awasome.....unlike ajanta we can not find paitings in ellora but sculptures are really good there too."
"From Mumbai we took a train to Aurangabad at 14.00 and we get there at 6.00 am, then a rickshaw to Ellora and the next day we contracted a rickshaw to go to Ellora Caves. The place is astonishing : there are temples, animals and different kind of statues carved in the rock; it took us half day to visit the 38 caves, climbing on top of the hill where the big temple is. Monkeys everywhere !!!! Don't forget your sunscreen and water (even if you can buy drinks there)."
"Ellora is beautiful and amazing - as simple as this. The Jain caves are a bit secluded and very pretty. The star of course, is Cave no. 16 - Kailash Mandir. This was carved over 700 years with primitive hand tools. To appreciate the beauty and the engineering, hire a guide. Wear footwear that is easy to remove and put on as you need to take off your shoes before entering some caves. Highly recommended!!"
Kailasa temple was worth the visit tot Ellora. The rest of the caves were ok
"This is one of ancient place of Indian History. Aurangabad is place in Maharastra. From bombay its 6to 7 hours far by car. It has many private buses services , trains available in country to visit Aurangabad and from there you can hire rickshaws or car to go Ellora cave. Its tourist main attraction of Maharastra, Many people every year visit Ellora cave, Its in the valley and very beautiful. Ancient Designs, sculptures, how they used to live you can see by visiting that place. There are some shop around to eat but i would not recommend to eat near by as I don't like there. better go to eat something with you from city. some hotels are around. Its very nice place to visit also , many people their told us to visit in july to october because rain and everywhere greenary will be there.thanks!!"
"Trip to Ellora caves was very memorable. The trip had picturesque view all the way. Lots of greenery and hill view. The Ellora caves are worth visiting. There are many caves and we visited around eight caves. Almost all the caves that we visited had the Shiva and Nandi statues. Caves number sixteen which is near cave one at the start, was very good. Once you enter the caves you search for signs of hidden treasure:-)"
Exellent Caves Unbelievable must to see as a big mountain cuted in caves just Fantastic. just 30 kms from aurangabad good road and nice screnery dont forget to take Photos on the Way. adventure tour ubnforgetabble
"This is my favourite place in India. This place of pilgrimage for three religions (hinduism, buddhism and jainism) it's fine both as historical and as an architectural monument. Besides here you will meet all India as indian tourists from all states. The big pleasure too :) No problems with transport and it is possible to reach this place from Aurangabad easily by the bus (the first in 5:30 mornings). We spend there two days usually and are ready to come again and again."
"A shorter day trip than Ajanta, and on better roads. Definitely recommend getting there at opening time. We headed straight for cave 16/Kailash, an easy walk from the parking area. Extremely impressive! If one has a basic knowledge of Hindu deities and art, one will recognize many of the sculptures and motifs in the Hindu caves. We skipped the guide here. There are reasonable signs that give some information. The caves were busy with Indian tourists; we saw no other Westerners. Everyone was friendly and it was reassuring to see many Muslim families enjoying the art and heritage of other major religions. You could tell it was a real ""day out"" for everyone. The Buddhist caves were very impressive, e.g. #10 which looks like a concrete bomb shelter at first, but which harbors beautiful sculpture and painting on the upper levels. There is a neat waterfall guided by carved rock conduits that was coursing over the walkway and providing natural air conditioning. We were a bit beat by the time we hit the Jain caves but they too were nice; if tired or pressed for time these could be given a lower priority. As stressed in guidebooks etc., #16 Kailash is truly amazing and we were happy we'd made a special trip to Aurangabad to see Ajanta and Ellore."
though Ellora caves are a part of world heritage site but after visiting there i felt i am at a place which is not been cleaned from 100s of years. government of India is doing nothing towards its maintenance....
A great architectural wonder that makes you wonder how people coule create a cave from top to bottom!!!!!!!Visit to believe...but it can be tiring too so if time is less visit only the Kailash Cave

Very beautiful caves. The Kailash temple is awesome and so beautiful. Must visit. Early morning trip is advisable if in the summer.
"Kailash temple, Buddha caves and Jain caves are marvelous, These are true unique in World wonders created by antient talented Indians Online tickets, so eazy pizzy. 4-5 hours required."
"This is a world heritage site and cave no 16 is having the largest monolithic structure in the world ,the kailash temple.We were there for 3 days from 26/02 to 28/02/21.We were accompanied by Mr Taqui whose Toyota Ethios we had hired for 6 days.Mr Taqui is a superb person with wide experience and knowledge of these historical sites.Contact no of Mr Taqui is 9511805424"
Amazing ancient architecture. The caves speak for themselves about the expertise of the individuals who enabled structures like these be possible in the times when it’s believed the technology we are used to didn’t exist. A must see place for anyone visiting Aurangabad.
"Ellora Caves UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITE is a must see in India. The caves about an hour from Aurangabad are absolutely marvelous. They are a combination of Jain, Hindu and Buddhist temples spread along a wall. Give yourself plenty of time to explore Temple 16. The world's largest monolith structure. There is a fee to enter and a bus is available to take you to the temples. When we went to Ellora it was a hot sunny day. So be sure to wear comfortable shoes, bring a hat and water. We had a guide which was very valuable to point explain the history and beautiful architecture."
It really is amazing how these caves were carved from the top down. It is a marvel of engineering. It's a relatively short drive from Aurangabad so not to be missed. You will not regret it.
My hubby loves reading anything about caves and this trip made it memorable and meaningful. Be awed by the carvings and imagine how they did it in those days! A lot of walking. Wear good shoes and you will be fine.
"These caves should not be missed by anyone with a passing interest in architecture, history temples or religion. They are a feat of engineering, made more spectacular by their age. The road is long and, and when we went, there was a lot of road construction on the road from Aurangabad so the journey took considerably longer than it would have had there been no construction. Plan to spend the better part of the day getting to and from, and exploring these magnificent temples."
Amazing place as curved out of single piece of rock. A lot of history and a lot of different caves to see. Also sellers not too pushy which makes the visit a lot better. Would recommend.
"It will take 4-5 hours of u want to visit all the caves, there are 34 caves based on Hindu, Buddh and Jain religion. Cave no. 1-12 are of Buddhist caves, cave no. 13 to 29 are Hindu caves and cave no. 30 to 34 are devoted to Jainism. Out of these caves if you have less time you can visit only cave no. 16 that is also called Kailash Temple, and cave no. 10 and 32. Entry fee is 40 Rs. Per person kids below 15 are exempted."
The Ellora caves are breathtaking. The sheer human effort to form the caves and for the period the work was undertaken is unbelievable. It was the highlight of our South India tour. It is well worth using the an official guide to take you around the site. It takes at least 3 hours to walk around the site.
A UNESCO World Heritage site and deservedly so. A MUST visit and be prepared to spend time there. A good guide will help you understand and appreciate these amazing carved out temples and monasteries.
"The title of my review says it all. This place is so breathtaking that everyone visiting here will turn speechless walking around the Kailasha temple. Carving out so many beautiful caves from a mountain with only hammer-chisel and human imagination is difficult to imagine. I recommend Ellora for all travellers to Aurangabad. Not sharing further details to enable exploration, though a lot is already available through Internet search."
I could not recommend more these caves. We had a wonderful visit. I believe this is one of the world’s most underrated sites.
"Must see them yourself to appreciate, a collection of Jain, Buddhist and Hindu caves and carvings/ sculptures from rock. Caves 16, 5, 10, 29, 33 and 34 impressed the most."
"We took a car from Aurangabad to Ellora. Roads are better and is nearer in comparison to Ajanta. Ellora is much bigger than Ajanta. After entering the first thing you see is cave 16 which is the Kailash temple. We took a guide for 500Rs who helped us interpret and see the main caevings. We spend an hour seeing the kailash temple. It's two storied. We then looked at the other caves starting from right. Every cave is unique in its own way either because of its magnitude, sound effects, or carvings. Caves 1-5 are simple. Then we waited for the bus to cover the remaining. Caves 18-28 are nearby. Other caves are about 700 to 1.5 km away. Among the last caves 30-34 is where you see a smaller version of the kailash temple. We ate sathe government hotel. Bathroom is clean. Food is clean and simple. Staffs are nice too. Outside vendors sell stone necklaces and stone carved items. While coming back ro Aurangabad, we stopped for saree purchase. The first few shops are cheaper. The silk palace was slightly expensive. Good collection of Himroo sarees."
"I've been coming here since my adolescence (at more than decade-long intervals), and I continue to be mind-blown. The care and upkeep have definitely improved. Transport aids the debilitated and lazy. And the rock carvings themselves remain astonishing. Hidden gems of Indian archeology/history."
We dropped by at Ellora caves on our way to Aurangabad from Pune. I had heard a lot about the caves and was not disappointed at all. Recommend hiring a certified guide to get the real stories and folklore to enjoy the experience to the fullest.
"Ajanta & Ellora caves – I don’t think any words or pictures can describe them. One has to experience these places to understand and celebrate the human achievement that is this place. To call these places caves is incorrect – these are temples and monasteries created by hand. Not wanting to belittle other monuments, but this place ranks heads and shoulders above all other places that I have visited in terms of scale, beauty, complexity of art and history. One must visit these places in a lifetime – not just for Indian but for people across the world. These places deserve a beyond excellent rating. The scale and the detailing will leave you awestruck. Essential – do get a government approved guide, although they are a little expensive – Rs. 1600 for a half day tour, but completely worth it. We were lucky to avail the services of Mr. Shaikh Ayas (a very seasoned expert guide, Ph 9326201109 and 9960904030, e – ayasuddinshaikh1@gmail.com) and suggest that you take his services by calling and booking much in advance. Ellora comprises of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain caves. These seem have to have been carved out almost 500 years subsequent to Ajanta. Ellora are much closer to Aurangabad and require only 1 hour to get here from Aurangabad. Grishneshwarji Mandir is a 5 minute from Ellora, and one must visit as this is one of the 12 Jyotirling. The carvings into the rock are more details and elaborate as compared to Ajanta, however, the level of damage is also greater here because of Ellora’s vicinity to human settlement. The Kailash temple at the centre of Ellora just takes your breath away. Once can easily spend the better half of the day here. We had an exceptional experience because of our guide here. One may also choose to carry a high powered torch to explore independently. After you have visited these places, you’ll realise the perfection and symmetry with which the work was carried out. There could be no mistakes while making any of these carvings – as all the structures are a part of a single piece of rock – no mistake – no mistake for over 100s of years over which these have been carved out – seems like an impossible task. That is another aspect that adds grandeur and makes these places worthy of respect."
"Magnificent,beautiful,amazing,unbelievable,mind blowing and many more adjectives but the beauty can't be summed up. It's a UNESCO world heritage site and a must visit in a lifetime. The entire Ellora visit took us around 3hrs. The caves features Buddhist,Hindu and Jain monuments.For Jain dedicated caves,you will get a government bus inside the ellora. We took the local guide costing around 500rs..You can also get government approved guides starting from rs.1600 and above. Do carry water bottles as you will not get anything inside."
"I had been to Ellora Caves on 26 September 2019 with my wife and grown up daughter. It is amazing!! There are 32 Caves. The place is situated some 28 km's away from Aurangabad City. Unlike the road to Ajanta the road is very good. After having the very bad experience of Ajanta road I would say this road is very very very very good. These caves talk about ancient Indian civilisation, culture and varied religions! The caves are of Jainism, Budhism and Hinduism. It talks also of the high teck knowledge of our people even in those days. There are 3D paintings there! The colours, all natural, have still not faded! The art work and skill is nonparallel. You have to be there to experience it. Avoid Monsoon season if you cannot enjoy it. You need about minimum FOUR hours to see around. Young children and very old guys may not be able to walk the whole distance. If interested in the history and story etc. you may engage a guide. Pls ensure that you pay him at the end of your trip. Otherwise read the books available from World Heritage Series make notes and visit. Carry a powerful torch. Wear comfortable foot wears."
The jain craves are actually jain mandirs. They are outstanding. Bus takes you up to the caves and than it's a short walk.
"It just stuns , the magnitude , the quality , the ambience, the effort , the concept and integration of knowledge with religion was soul touching"
Kailash cave / temple is an out of this world architectural wonder. So is the huge three storied Buddhist monastery. The musical stupa combining Hinayana /Mahayana styles in acoustic wooden plank-like two storied cave leaves you numbed with joy! Just chant Om and listen to echo!
"30 kms away from the Vivanta by Taj Hotel - entrance fee of 550 ringette per person if paying by card, otherwise it is 600 if using cash. Lots of people trying to sell their wares again as you head into the grounds. Good 2/3 hrs of walking around and viewing in and out these fascinating caves, stunning … Toilets in the grounds which are passable .."
"Beautiful is the only word to describe it. The place is for stone carvings, some of them really beautiful. There are only 3-4 caves which can largely cover most of what you would want to see. A must visit, given the fact it is extremely close to the city (about 30 mins drive)."
During our recent trip to Aurangabad for a Medical conference we preplanned a visit to Ellora caves We reached Aurangabad late eveni g and drive straight to Ellora to stay overnight at Hotel Kailas (next door to Ellora ) This enabled us to start early morning - by 6.45 -7 am thus missing the tourist rush and enjoying pleasant weather . We started from the Bhudhist caves which are on the left once you enter and also took services of a guide Then we went to the main cave number 16 -Kailas temple which is really a impressive structure and one should and cam spend one to one and a half hour there to really enjoy its majestic beauty The place and surroundings are very well maintained and clean and green Most people (strangely ) wait for the bus to explore the other caves (cave 29 with a huge waterfall ) and the jain caves which actually are just 1-1.5 km and easily walkable (especially if weather is conducive ) We walked and covered all the caves easily and intact enjoyed the experience even more The buses usually start late (9.30-10) and are quite run Down By 10.30 we were out and had a nice breakfast just outside enjoying the local pav wada and bhaji Overall very impressive indeed.
This is very big and beautiful. absolutely worth to know the truth behind the caves and its carvings. Thoroughly enjoyed visiting each of the caves. Well maintained and good for foreigners also. always good to know historical facts and evolution of humans over the period of time.
"Ellora is around 20kms from Aurangabad city. We had hired a car and it took around 40minutes to reach. There is an entry fee of Rs.40 for Indian Citizens and there are no charges for Camera. Straight ahead of the entrance is Cave 16, the Kailasa temple. I would suggest visiting this first, since this is the best part of Ellora caves. This is probably the only architectural marvel where the structure has been built by cutting a single rock from the top. Built by the Kings of Rashtrakuta dynasty ( 7th Century CE), the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Temple is built based on South Indian Architecture. While you can see most of the temple with your footwear on,you need to remove it to enter the hall where the sanctum is located ( maha mandapa) There are some nice carvings outside the temple. As you enter,a big sculpture of Gajalakshmi ( Godess with Elephants) is what you see first. On the left and right sides there 2 life size elephant statues. The one on your right is mostly destroyed. There are 2 very tall pillars with a square base on right and left side. There is a River Godess shrine to your left (North side of temple). Take a round around the temple going through the cloisters. On the north side you can see multiple Shiva sculpture. You will see many more Shiva Sculptures, Brahma and Vishnu too on the Eastern Cloister. On the South Cloister you can see multiple sculptures of Vishnu. The foundation of temple is built as if it rests on row of elephants. There are multiple sculptures around ( like elephant and Lion fighting). Don't miss the Ravana lifting Mount Kailasha on the South Side. There are 2 panels with Mahabharatha story ( on North) and Ramayana ( on South side) as well. You need to climb up to the Maha Mandapa and the hall in from Sanctum offers some great carvings on the pillars. There are one too many beautiful sculptures all around on the walls. Some part of the walls shows the remnants of paintings ( as in Ajanta Caves), but most of it is gone. Other Caves: Caves 1-12 are Budhist caves and cave 10 or Vishwakarma cave is a notable one. This is a chaitya ( place of worship) and like the caves 19 and 26 in Ajanta. Caves 11 and 12 are huge monasteries. You need to remove the footwear in Cave10. Caves 13 to 29 are Hindu Caves and has multiple carvings. Caves 30 to 34 are Jain caves. The walking path after Cave 26 was blocked and we had to come back near the entrance and take a bus to Jain caves ( around 5min by bus). Look for some good paintings inside the Jain Sanctum, on the walls. If you are an history, art buff Ellora can easily take a full day to see. Kailasa temple itself can take half a day. This is a lifetime experience and it is worth spending that time.. One can't leave this place without admiring the people who created these caves."
"Amazing... especially the cave 15 - Shiva temple carved out from top of the hill. The temple has 2 storeys... I believe this is the only cave in world where a structure is carved from the top to bottom of the hill. There are multiple caves (1 to 32) in the venue. Every caves are carved out of rock, consists of huge statues 15 to 20 ft high... It should be called as caves of huge sculptures. I am person who is very much interested in archaeology and sculptures... hence I took 8 hours to go around the places."
"Visited quite a lot of rock-cut monastery-temple cave complexes around the world, but Ellora (also called Verul) is exceptional of all because of Kailash Temple of Cave No. 16. Ellora caves are symbolized by the magnamous plinth of the mighty Shiva Temple. There are altogether 3 clusters of caves belonging to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism religion. Every visitor prioritises the Kailash Temple which becomes the highlight of the visit and return without savouring the splendid artwork of other caves which are distant to the central Cave No. 16. Here are few tips for the fellow travellers (based on personal experience): 1. Choose the right time of the year. Winters are not quite cool unless you arrive early in the morning. Avoid any public holiday. 2. There is a general tendency to club Ellora caves with other attractions, because of the proximity to Aurangabad. Well, visitors would always want to cover maximum in minimal time. However, I suggest to spend 3-4 hours in the cave complex. There is so much to view in the Cave 16 with ample of photographic opportunities. One can easily spend 1.5 to 2 hrs here. 3. Get the shuttle to the extreme left cluster of caves 30-34. These are not to be missed. Since most of the visitors are fully satisfied with Kailash Temple, there is less crowd in here, and you get to enjoy the caves to yourself at your own peace. 4. Get a drop-off at Y-junction for cave 29, another must see. 5. On the other side of Cave 16, the Buddhist and Hindu caves from 1-15, try to venture no. 10 and 14. 6. Beware of Langurs. There are hordes in the premises. They love to munch on your snacks and drinks. 7. Like other sites, Archeological Survey of India has published an informative booklet on Ellora. It is available with heavy discount in the ticketing counter. If you want, just ask for it, it is not on display. Enjoy the rich heritage of Indian art and culture."
"Personally I preferred and loved the Buddhist caves, it had less people and hence really helped reflect on the history and our place in time! The Kailasa temple while off course a lot more magnificent and definitely a must do, was so much more crowded. But definitely do as many of the caves possible and really soak up the past... while gawking at the almost impossible architecture and craftsmanship of our ancestors... and wonder like most, how these magnificent structures were humanly possible so far back!"
"No words can describe the grandeur of Ellora caves and no camera can capture its gigantic scale. Cutting a massive building out of single rock, top to bottom, that form these mountains in stone ages was impossible because even today such technology doesn't exist in our modern world. You don't have to an architect, historian or archaeological expert to understand this fact! I've see Egyptian Pyramids and other Wonders of the world but nothing compares to these astonishing 100 caves spread over acres and acres and housing millions of Indian historical enlightened beings and their disciples - from Shiva to Buddha to Mahaveera, all three periods coexisted right next to each other unti Arab & European invaders came and distroyed what was built over centuries and remained an active place of worship & housed many educational institutions teaching Shiva's, Buddha's and Mahaveera's words besides other academic subjects."
"Ellora Caves offer the most mesmerising peek into the religious cultures of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. These centuries old caves, now a UNESCO heritage site, are a must visit in one's lifetime. The caves have beautiful, unbelievable carvings and sculptures, which were made in an era of no machinery. One just winders at the marvel of the caves. Kailash Temple, Buddhist caves and Jain caves are distinctly different and one gets a real feel of these cultures. Totally totally worth visiting. Some tips: -try to go early morning, as it becomes very lot later in the day -it's good to get a guide but guides don't stay to show all the caves. They just show the main ones in an hour or so, and want to rush to other customers. So better to negotiate for a full tour of all caves at your pace (not at the guide's speed, else you won't be able to take any photos) -You can buy a guidebook at the entrance (150-200 bucks) or download some guides from the internet -- one must not visit the main main attractions in these caves -Carry lot of water ; refills are available inside, but better to carry own water -hand fan is good to carry -do take an umbrella -Elderly people may find it difficult to go in the caves which have stairs -There is no climbing at all ; the caves are very approachable, and well maintained -- so don't worry about trekking to the caves -Budget at least 3-4 hours if you want to see the main caves properly (with lots of photos) -Wear comfortable shoes, coz there is walking involved -Wear light, comfy clothes -there are lot of restaurants outside the caves, so lunch won't be an issue"
"It was a bit hot, please visit post lunch when temperature is a bit tolerable. Take lots of water. Also, visit cave #16 first. It's not too difficult for kids to climb"
"Ellora is an incredible work of craftsmanship, carved from one enormous hill of stone. The intricacy of the carving and the sheer size of this ancient place of worship are incomprehensible without seeing them first hand. Visit recommended"
"The ""caves"" at Ella are a must see in India. Forgotten an hidden for many years these monolithic structures are beautiful, historical and spiritual records of ancient India. The stories told in the carvings and paintings within these caves give one a glimpse of the importance of the lives of the gods in Indian history and contemporary life. These caves are the products of three religions, Hinduism, Jain and Buddhism which converge at this World Heritage Site. Do not miss a visit to these caves."
"It is really interesting to see. It is worth to pronounce aum voice in the caves, makes you feel nice."
"A visit to India, without visiting Aurangabad, specially Ajanta, Ellora is a trip wasted. A highly under estimated place with very few Indian and International visitors. There are direct flights from Mumbai and the roads from Aurangabad to any of these world heritage sights are excellent. Security is no problem. The locals are too good and friendly and you will not find any of the standard tourist traps. Plan for a full day outing to really enjoy the beauty in detail. Do also remember that summers is not the right time (rocks spew fire!), winters will be fine but we enjoyed September due to pleasant temperatures as also lush green mountains, which dry up in winters! You can marvel at the capability of our forefathers who executed it. Even today with the latest technology and equipment, it seems to be next to impossible to execute it. Please do visit and be surprised."
"The Ellora caves are absolutely beautiful. The Kailasa Temple is a monolithic structure carved from top downwards. Intricate carvings that have withstood time. There are friezes with carvings that tell the story of the Mahabharata and Ramayana. Do climb up from the side to get a view of how the temple was carved from the top and it will leave you in awe of the craftmanship of the amazing artisans of the past. Other caves may not be as elaborate but they are just as beautiful. Cave 10, the Viswakarma Cave Temple has a 15 feet Buddha. It has a beautiful echo effect and the chanting must have sounded so divine. Try and spend at least half a day if not the full day to get an idea of the place. The Jain Caves are a distance away and there is a shuttle that will take you there. Each cave has its own beauty. Get a good guide who will be with you the whole time. It is totally worth it."
"Caves in Ellora are good example of Amazing man made marvel. Very well maintained, clean. But Caves are spread in huge area. So if one is keen seeing all of them, it may take entire day. But Kailas Temple & few other caves are must visit"
The Ellora caves with majestic Kailash Temple is a sight to behold. Believe it not should have been included in the wonders of the world and no visit to india is complete without the visit of this and Ajanta paintings.
"Nothing more to describe the well known splendor and beauty of the Ellora caves. This was our second visit and still took us 2 days to cover all the caves. Don't miss any single cave as each one is unique and there is something worth viewing in each and every cave. Our personal favorites were caves 15 and 20. We took the 10/- bus from entrance on first day to finish caves 30 - 34 and 1-14. On second day we had a leisurely viewing of caves 15 - 29. Cave 29 is a roundabout trek, however there is a shortcut to road from cave 24-25 cluster through shrubs, if you look for it. Carry your own food,water and torch. For serious archaeology lovers, prepare well before you visit so you can watch out for hidden gems. ASI has very good books published on Ellora available at ticket counter and plenty of info is available on net. The cheap roadside guidebooks and guides are a waste. Don't fall for their trap. we heard a lot of wrong info being told by such guides just for sake of tips. Each cave already has a board with details from ASI."
I traveled to Aurangabad for a lesuire travel with my friends and wanted to explore we went to different places but liked Ellora caves. Such a beautiful atmosphere.
"The caves are a wonder and I was really amazed by the sculptures. There are a lot of caves, I believe around 34 caves are open to the public. Please keep in mind there will be a lot of walking if you plan to cover all of the caves and it gets really hot in the summers. The best time to visit them is in the monsoon when the greenary encompass the entire structure. The caves are very nicely maintained and it will take one full day if you are really into exploring every cave and will be very exhausting but completely worth it!"
"Will just say no words to explain the Mixture of Art,Architecture,Civil, Geology,Fashion,Culture,Unity in diversity and many more Amazing Things."
"Ellora, located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India, is one of the largest rock-cut monastery-temple cave complexes in the world, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, featuring Buddhist, Hindu & JAin Caves."
I personally suggest that you must visit this place with so many aves and ancient culture in stone form. their some advisory write that Ellora caves are only rock but its not true its very beautiful when comes to nature. have water fall also and a good garden too.
"Worth to visit! 34 caves open to public, get a knowledgeable tour guide, and you can understand the sculpture & building better. It is about the history of Buddhist, Hindu & Jain. Many traders will approach you, and the prices can be reduced by 50%. Weather very hot, about 46 degree Celsius. Apply sufficient sunblock lotion & protective gear."
"These are near to Aurangabad, so easy to approach. Better will be to read a bit on wiki beforehand and spend quality time at selected caves. I suggest keep about 3-4 hrs to visit. The caves from 27th (mostly Jain caves) onward were blocked due to a landslide. If you want to visit, you will have to take the road and approach from cave no 32/30 (left side of main entrance). Guide may not be required if you have done a bit of reading on wiki beforehand. Spend quality time at selected caves (Kailash is biggest) and few Buddhist caves. The Kailash temple (1st big structure right in front of entry) is worth spending quality time. If you have time, climb from the side to go on top of the hill. Gives an idea on the scale. There are not many decent places to eat nearby (MTDC has a very basic restaurant)"
"Famous Kailash Temple. Just 30-40 mins drive from Aurangabad. Ellora is a rock cutting ancient Hindu Temples. Cave no -16 most important it is famous kailash Temple. There is total 32 caves. It is a single rock temple and cutting from upside. Amazing architecture you can view. How they cut rock and make it smooth. Cave no 1-16 you can view by walking but for 17-32 you need to take bus in front of Cave no. 16. Everybody read and listen about ancient Indian architecture, and it is the example of that. Carry sunglass and cap is must as sun will burn you, but you can take rest inside caves and temples."
"Our first visit to Ellora though we've lived in India for over 35 years, somehow did not get the opportunity. This is a fabulous example of cave carving and sculpture, sadly a lot of damage due to successive Muslim intolerance. Many Buddhist visitors from all over East Asia, deeply reverential of the Buddhist era carvings and sculptures."
"Yes a must visit place, hardly 40 mins drive from Aurangabad city and mind blowing carvings, almost nil Fresco's but the carvings in many caves are in good condition. Ellora is divided into 5 divisions. 1 to 15 caves on one side, in centre cave 16, then caves 17to 28, cave no 29, and 30 to 34. We did 1 to 15 in which cave no 2 is gigantic and cave no 10 was different. Well the cave no 16 is the place to visit and known as kailasha it is the world's largest excavated place. And has left researchers, scientist and archeologists perplexed into how it was done . Go there please, it should actually feature in world's wonders of the world. I don't know how to put it down you have 50ft thick rocks protuding 30 ft from pillars carving which have been done from the top to bottom. You then have to take bus which drops to you to 30 to 34 caves, visit the 32 no cave in very good condition.. then again catch the bus and drop at 29 no cave, huge huge and excellent, how did these people at those times do it. We skipped 17 to 28 as we were running out of time and one of us was not so well. But we know we are going to come again next winter so will do that then. Must keep whole day for ellora caves, must keep two torches, extra batteries for camera, comfortable shoes , water bottles are available but brands are unknown."
"An architectural wonder and tribute to the rich culture and history of India. Caves 16 and 29 are spectacular. Be forewarned: there are lots of steep stone stairs to climb, and some walking on uneven paths. A bus will take you to the farthest group of caves, the Jain. Buy a guidebook with color photos that will identify the sculptures inside the caves. You do not need to hire a guide, but they are available and plentiful if you want one."
"The caves themselves are wonderful but there ends the positives. The facilities are appalling. The entire places, inside and outside is littered with garbage. Granted the vast majority of public visiting is illiterate and ignorant. But shouldn't there be tourist police and volunteers to stop this? There should be a cage at the entrance where they lock up anyone who throws garbage. The hill side, the stream, and the parking lot, all are fraught with garbage. The bus to the Jain caves is from 1940s and rickety and belches black fumes. Only one in 10 guides is government approved. Rest are frauds who charge less but misinform. Government guides charge way too much and the set rate is INR 1600. It is a miracle this place has UNESCO status. It should be revoked. That is what may wake up the Indian government. Until then, go at your own risk. If you can close your eyes to the garbage and focus on the caves, go. The toilets are dirty, foul smelling and the ladies toilet usually has a line of 25 women."
"The Kailash, Kailasanatha temple is the unmatched structure in the world situated in Ellora. This is designed to recall Mount Kailash, the abode of Bhagwan Shiv – stands tall, enclosed within a big manmade crater, surrounded by rock. It is world’s oldest single rock carved, multi-storeyed temple complex. West archaeologists were awestruck and compared to notice that it is double the size of Parthenon in Athens. After being closely monitored, several experts also found that initially the temple was entirely covered with white plaster to increasingly resemble the snow covered Mount Kailash."
"dear all, i have visited the ellora caves in the month of August and felt very happy while watching the so much sculpture that made in the ancient days. 1) While visiting he ellora caves please keep LED light torch with you so that you will able to see all the sculptures which are in the dark. 2) Also please plan for whole day to see all the caves about approx.36 caves. Go in a group so that u will enjoy a lot. 3) Don't go by govt. bus unless u are not able to walk.Bus is helpful for old age people and children.Children who are eager to walk and enjoy the surroundings can go by walk. 4) Know about the history and details about the Ellora caves before going there so that there will be a satisfaction for what u observed there."
"Caves are closed Tuesdays and when open are fascinating to see and also to observe the tourists. Most people spend their time on Cave 16 / the Kailasanatha Temple and the one or two either side, however all of the 34 odd caves are fascinating and worth the time to visit, as we did the majority of them. Some caves are closed off at various times. Also be aware that Caves 30 to 34 could not be accessed by the walking trail as it had collapsed and been 'fenced' off. They can be reached by the shuttle bus that departs from a place below Cave 16 and runs to Cave 31 at the end. Make sure to bring your own water and food, it is a lot of walking in the exposed sun. Also wear good shoes as the majority of the paths and caves are rocky, uneven ground."
"This caves are 35 km away from city. You can hire a taxi for a trip, It will take at least 4hrs to see all attractions in the ancient caves, You can also book through MTDC(Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation) for the visit and also have accommodation facility.You can reach Aurangabad by Air/ train/ road. There are few other attractions to see."
"Ellora Caves at located at ~30 kms from Aurangabad, Maharashtra. The caves are popularly also known as Verul Leni (Leni = Caves) because of its proximity to Verul Village. Popular mode of transport is State Transport (ST) Bus service or cab. The place starts closing at ~5.30 pm. This was my 3rd visit to the Ellora caves and the place never ceases to amaze me. Would recommend to start from Cave 1 and keep aside minimum 3 hrs to thoroughly explore the caves. Its a real wonder how these caves would have been carved in 7th and 8th century. The real marvel is the Kailash temple, which in fact is worlds largest monolith of the world."
"I have visited 4 out of the ""7-wonders-of-the-world""... but after exploring Ellora Caves, those wonders stand nothing in front of this Amazing man-made 34 caves of Ellora. Ellora Caves deserve to be among the 7 wonders. Cave No.16 (Hindu God ""Lord Shiva"" temple complex): The whole rocky hill was cut & excavated from top-to-bottom and scooped out all through from outside to inside. 10 generations worked for more than 200 years during 7th century AD. Tips: Start exploring from Cave No.16, since this is the biggest and the best and will need time to explore. Then proceed to Cave 15, 14 till 10. You can go upto Cave 1 and then proceed from Cave 17 till Cave 34. For Hindu devotees/pilgrims who will visit nearby Lord Shiva Jyotirling ""Grishneshwar"" Temple, start your day from temple darshan and then proceed to Ellora Caves starting with Cave No.16. How to Reach: Local Bus or Rental Taxi go from Aurangabad city to Ellora."
"These caves are world famous and must be visited by everyone, particularly Kailash temple is excellent having very old Lord Shiva Temple and pictures of mahabharat etc. This temple was made from digging the rocks from top and worth seeing."
"Been there in month of Oct-2016 when there were rains. Kaiasha temple is one of the most iconic spot here, as per archaeologist about 5000 Tonnage of Rock must have been evacuated to carve temple from stone. Though we are living in modern age and seek all possibilities of doing this with help of machines but at time stone age approx 1000 years ago hard to believe how they did it....must visit for every one"
"We did Ellora AFTER the Daulatabad fort. And that was probably a mistake. That fort is HUGE and saps you of any energy you may have. After that Ellora was just not worth doing. We only visited the Cave 16 (or 15) which is the Kailasa temple. The carvings are magnificent and at some point, the whole place was painted. Again, this is also in ruins with little effort to preserve whatever little is left of the caves. The rest of the caves are just caves, nothing much to see in any of them. Easily 4kms walking required to see everything. Do NOT plan this on a hot day, carry sufficient water. We parked at the MTDC parking which is about 400 meters from the entrance to ellora caves. The parking facilities are good and there are some restaurants outside, but nothing so clean that I would venture to eat at any of those places. The MTDC restaurant inside was empty so we decided to go back without having lunch."
"Gather your energy resources,put on walking shoes and a cap,carry water and get set to travel back thousands of years. Beautiful carvings in Cave 14 and 16 These are Carvings based on Hindu mythology and Gods and Goddesses....Wonderstruck by the ancient beauty Also worth a visit 10,11,12 Buddha statues Return to start and catch the local bus(16rs Ticket) to caves30-34 Have to be ready to walk and climb ......but worth the effort"
"If you are looking for a taxi to show you around the city or take you out to the caves just call Mirza Hussain +919860367110. He and his father Taqui operate a great service. Showed up at our hotel bright and early and got us to the caves before anyone else was there. To have Ellora all to ourselves was magical to say the least. Ajanta is not to be missed either. He went above and beyond in answering all our questions and showing us the sites we wanted without rushing or pressure. We are in our mid twenties and found him very polite and relatable. Great guy, family operated local business. Highly recommended. If I could suggest anything it would be to provide some literature for us to take into the caves/sites with us. Thanks Mirza and Taqui!"
"One of the largest rock-cut monastery-temple caves complexes in the world dating from 600-1000 AD and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Really Incredible! 34 caves extending over more than 2 km dug side by side in the wall of a high basalt cliff existing of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain religious monuments. Cave 16 the Kailash temple features the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world - a chariot shaped monument dedicated to Shiva carved out of one single rock."
"I had just 1 day to cover Ellora & Aurngabad so started early.There are in tital 36 caves distrubuted between three religious faith Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism. The most famous is the no 10 cave which also has the Kailash Mandir. Ome should hire an official guide as they really explain well. The cravings are one of the best example our rich cultural history which showcases that even expression can be depicted on the rocks.The Buddhist caves have very minimilastic working but throughly enjoyable. Take ample time to visit every cave and the waterfall in the moonsoon is an added bonus."
"The Ellora caves are quite stunning, more than 60 cut into a cliff face and carved out, monolithic basalt, not built up at all. Some were gigantic, with big rooms, all with ornate carvings on walls, columns and ceilings, and some with vestiges of paintings still visible. Some were Jain, Buddhist and others were Hindu up to about 600-1000CE. We spent much of the day there, trundling in one of the faded local buses or dashing to the coolth of the next cave. Amod (basoleamod@gmail.com) our superb guide, fascinated and proud of the heritage, himself very fascinating and articulate (brilliant English), full of facts, stories and explanations, there was so much interest from us that we continued talking about Ellora on the bus. He is quite the best guide we have met ever. He was also able to offer full answers to our questions about the religions and sacred stories, the crops, the structural aspects of the caves, the metallurgy of the masons’ tools, etc. There were hundreds of Indian tourists taking advantage of the Christmas break, and we were often politely asked if we would be in their photos or even surreptitiously photoed as background for selfies. But universally treated in a welcoming, friendly and polite way. There were not many foreigners around, so be prepared to be asked to pose in a photo os a complete stranger. Well worth a visit, specially with a good guide."
"Amazing architectural feat to have carved all the sculptures in the temples in the caves, everything hewn out of solid rock without the modern equipment now available. One has to see it to appreciate what they managed to achieve. One has to be fairly fit to be able to get to many of the temples, but definitely not to be missed."
Overall the caves and the sculptures there are very interesting. Though they would have looked amazing if were not broken. Well maintained and these monuments are great learning for kids. Great place for a change.
"Ellora is to the West of Aurangabad city (unlike Ajanta which is North). Ellora is about 35 Kms from Aurangabad and can be reached easily by road. The place is called ""Verul"" in local language. There is an excellent Visitor Centre in Ellora as well. You can park your vehicle safely here. Also the visitor centre has models of the Ellora Caves and gives good information about them. Do take a tour - its free! There is also an auditorium where you can see an audio-visual of the Ellora caves with narration in English/Hindi/Japanese/French - which gives an excellent summary of the caves, their origin and evolution. Must visit the Visitor Centre first and prepare yourself for whats coming! I'll not repeat the information about the caves, as its available in plenty on the web. Just a couple of points - wear a cap or hat as it can get very hot (the hills and stones radiate heat); carry a water bottle; wear shoes. The sculptures are truly magnificient! The Kailash temple - and temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, is completely carved out of a single rock - at about 95 feet high - its one of its kind in the world. The vision of the architect, the sheer audacity to even contemplate building something like this - and finally the engineering skill to execute and complete what was envisioned - is all a marvel and a magnificient tribute to India and Indians. While we were colonised and rubbed to the ground for centuries, when we see such grandeur we can lift our heads and be proud that our past generations had the courage/vision/skill to create such poetry from hard rock! In fact, the 3 storey rock cut caves (for dwelling) and the 2 storey ones are so well proportioned and decorated, they would qualify as 5 star hotels of their times! Each and every sculpture is so well proportioned and life like, the stories we've heard of Shiva, the Ramayan, the Mahabharat, the Buddha all come alive when you look at them. Look out for the minerals in the rocks - you'll see streaks of various colours - red (iron/rust), white (calcium), blue, purple etc. Its awesome to see the earth present a rainbow in rock! Note: You have to take a bus from the start point - to see the Jain caves (27 - 34) which are about 1 km away. Once you've finished seeing the caves and return to the start point, you'll find lot of road side fruit vendors and restaurants. Plenty of pineapple, guava, coconut, bananas, water melons available. Of course a variety of food stuffs are available as well. On your way back from Ellora to Aurangabad - you can see 3 other attractions - a) the Daulatabad Fort b) The Pan-chakki c) the Bibi ka Maqbara. Hope you enjoy the trip and reverberate the message of Ellora to the world - ""Beauty can be created even from the hardest of rocks if we have it in our heart to see it, and patience and courage to believe in it""."
"Right across the road, in front of Ellora Caves, there is main office of authority. The parking is available there. There are 2 options available. One is that you see the video and get full idea of caves and then visit. In this case you need not hire a guide. Second option is to hire a guide. The ones available outside the gate are cheaper from the govt approved guides available at ticket window. But visiting without seeing the video or without guide is waste of time, as you will not be able to understand even 5% of the caves. There is entry fee of Rs 30/- per head and you can carry water and eatables with you. The main attraction is cave no 16, right in front of entrance gate, named Kailasa Temple, is proud example of rich architects of India."
"Floors caves is an incredibly beautiful place to visit if in the area temples cut from the rock gorge with plenty of greenery through out. You'll need the whole day and a decent brolly to shade from the sun when outside but the temples are stunning and cool if you need a cool down I would recommend a torch so you can see where your walking in some of the caves and be aware flash photography is not permitted in some other than that you be amazed by all you see, back at the car park there are lot of stalls selling gifts and things so do visit here as well but do barter because there are plenty of vendor's so don't accept the first price they offer."
To think that Cave 16 at this site was carved from the top down gives you an idea of how incredible an architectural feat these caves are. Beautiful images and spaces. Absolutely one of the best sites we visited in India.
"If you are in dilemma whether to choose Ajanta or Ellora (if you plan to visit just either of the one) then I recommend Ellora. Especially don't miss Cave#16 which is right at the entrance in case you wish to skip other caves. In contrast to Ajanta this will be less tiring and can finish fast. Here too you need to take bus to get to the entrance. Also, you will see a good crowd in Cave#16 so plan your time of visit perhaps before the evening. Finally there is nothing much to shop here so you might keep this place off shopping list."
"This review is mostly of Kailash Temple Ellora. I always have fascination of visiting this place after reading Satyajit Ray's book. So to me it childhood revisited. The structure is amazing and completely unbelievable that 4000 years back people created this place without help of any tool. You will find alien like structure, big pillars, humanoid structure and everything is just awesome. I have visited few other caves out of those two storied caves are another awesome cave to visit."
"Easily the finest demonstration of Indian sculpting techniques, the Ellora caves are an unmissable site that anybody travelling to Aurangabad must see"
This is place that i like most because it is most historical and heritage og india that is inportant to know old indian culture
"Ellora comprises of sculptures as Ajanta comprises of paintings as well as sculptures. There is a bus to take you from one set of caves to another set of caves. In total there are 3 set of caves, one for each religion, Hindu, Buddhist and Jain. Amazing carving in stone. Especially Cave 16 which is mostly the starting point for the tour."
This place is worth visiting with some time on hand and very comfortable walking shoes and a good supply of drinking water. The grandeur of the carvings and the magnitude is breath taking.
"Ellora caves near aurangabad are one of the most beautiful and amazing place to visit specially in mansoon when waterfall becomes active above buddhist caves and greenary around the place makes it amazingly picturesque...! In general there are 34 caves buddhist,hindu and jains caves carved from550 AD till 1000 AD.These caves are spread across approx 2 km range. Each caves and statues are silently telling known and unknown stories of history.There is some sort of mystery about distant bygone era and as though these caves are silently witnessing the time!Cave no 16 kailashnath temple cave is major attraction."
"I went on 8th July 2016 to aurangabad for a tour. As I am single I dont have the budget to take a car for rent. Morning I reached at the bus depot and took msrtc special bus to ellora caves. It includes Daulatabad Fort (Devagiri Fort ) Bibi ka Maqbara & Panchakki. Bus took from morning 8:30 Am from stand. About ellora caves From Aurangabad nearly 29 km distance. Because of the short trip first day only I got 3 hours in ellora which I visit cave no 16, 10, & 32 .I thought tomorrow full day i will spend in ellora.Next day morning I took bus going to Dhoole from aurangabad depot I reached by 9 am & I spend the whole day there. Superb really wondered about the people who crave it. Amazing never miss cave 32 16 10. Total there are 34 caves. And more than the climate was awesome. I dont have words to describe. Really awesome. Timings from morning 6:am to 6 :pm and entrance fees is 30 rupees for indian national. And children below 15 is free. Weekly there is a off on Tuesday in ellora. So please check the leave in site also. If you spent one day you can always say that I have seen a unesco world heritage spot. More than that you will get good memories."
"Nice place to visit near by aurangabad..their are 34 caves in this area...Caves are classified as 1-12(Buddhist Group), 13-29 (Hindu Group), 30-34 (Jain Group) If you are planning to visit this place then 4-5 hours are required to fully visit all caves...for jain caves you have to travel from bus which is 500 metre away from no. 1 cave...Must visit cave no. 16 which is the best from all of them"
"Like Ajanta, this is one of the best places in India to visit if one is a fan of history/culture and archaeology. The main cave which is a rock cut temple is simply astounding for its sheer size and delicate rock art. You can find more information on the internet. The caves can be easily visited by private vehicle which can be parked at the entrance. Onwards, you can walk to the caves or board onto Tourism Dept, bus. Since we were all fit to walk, we chose to walk to each cave. There is a separate entrance ticket and a bus ticket. The caves are well maintained with good cleanliness as well as information boards explaining the history of the caves. If you would like to visit all the caves, plan to spend a night in Aurangabad which is well connected to all other major cities."
"One hour drive from Aurangabad airport with two decent resorts to stay near by. Go to temple 16 which is vertically carved out from the top by 3 generations 1500 years ago. Must take a guide to show you around otherwise it will look very boring and repetitive. Guide tells you finer points. Other temple to see is number 10 if you are short of time. No need for guide there. If you still have time, go to the one with a water fall. If you have lots of time see them all."
"Ellora is an archaeological site 29 km (18 mi) north-west of the city of Aurangabad in the Indian state of Maharashtra, built by the Rashtrakuta dynasty (Brahmanical & Buddhist group of caves) and Yadav (Jain group of caves). Well known for its monumental caves, Ellora is an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ellora represents the epitome of Indian rock-cut architecture. The 34 ""caves"" are actually structures excavated out of the vertical face of the Charanandri hills. Hindu, Buddhist and Jain rock-cut temples and viharas and mathas were built between the 5th century and 10th century. The 17 Hindu (caves 13–29), 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves, built in proximity, demonstrate the religious harmony prevalent during this period of Indian history. It is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India."
Astonishing. Very difficult to believe these caves were carved out from the top down. Seeing these caves would have been sufficient to justify the entire trip to India.
Ellora Caves are situated near Aurangabad are worth visit. This place needs full day to see all caves leisurely. Half day is enough in fast pace. Tuesday is holiday for caves. Need to walk more to see all caves. Autos are available to see the important caves.
"Kailash Temple, cave no 16 ( if i am not mistaken) is the main cave. Situated in the centre, you see the kailash as soon as you reach Ellora. Government buses ply to Ellora from Aurangabad and cost Rs 30 - Rs 40 pp. Travel time is close to an hour. On the way you get to view the Daulatabad Fort. Kailash will take your breath away. This was my second visist and I was equally in awe as I was the first time. A mountain carved into a temple from top to bottom. If you dont see it you wont believe. Intricate details carved all around. The Ramayana is inscribed on a single stone. Lost too see and it takes again 3 to 4 hours. A delight for photographers as well. The rest of the caves are goo too but kailash is by far the best."
"Ellora is close to Aurangabad city and we took MTDC (Maharashtra Tourism Dev Co-op) Volvo bus to visit Ellora.. The bus leaves by 8:30 in the morning. Lot of taxi drivers will come and say Volvo will be late and all...but it is on time and will give a much better experience than going by a taxi. Ellora is similar to Ajanta, but the main difference being the cave no.16 in Ellora. That cave is just unbelievable!!! It is a temple carved out of rock. It is one awesome experience to be there in that place. Carry water bottles , otherwise surely you will get dehydrated."
"After spending a great day at Ajanta arrived at Ellora with a lot of hopes. Firstly, these caves are easier to access compared to Ajanta, closer to Aurangabad city and developed like a park. Considering it's vicinity to the city they attract a larger crowd. The uniqueness of Ellora is that they offer Hindu, Jain and Buddhist carvings and kind of represent the diversity of India. Caves 1-12 are Buddhist caves and felt a bit lackluster when compared to Ajanta. Impressive 3 story accommodation and a large monastery carved within the caves is a salient feature of these caves Cave 16, named as Kailas is the Hindu cave and offers some excellent display of stone carvings. It is a Hindu temple that celebrates various Hindu gods and also offers some fables and mythological carvings. This is by far the best Ellora has to offer. Ellora is approximately 2 hours activity so add a few attractions to spend your day well. There are a few other attractions around Ellora like the Ghrishneshwar Shiv temple, Deogiri/Daulatbad fort and some silk weaving factories enroute."
"Most buildings start with flat ground and build up block by block -- if you make a mistake, make another block. This place started with a solid rocky hill and removed rock leaving buildings, statues, temples. Cave 16 (the most impressive) took over 200 years to create (and no blueprints). Take the shuttle to cave 33 and then walk to the lower numbered caves (no need to go back to the shuttle). If one is careful, they can take a wide path up the hill (past the do not enter sign) to look down into cave 16. It was hot (85 F or 30 C), so take water and good walking shoes."
"The Ellora Caves outside Aurangabad are a must for any history or religious buffs. You don't need to BE religious, only appreciate these Magnificant works. We didn't do all the caves, following the highlights of 10, 12 (not a huge highlight for me), 16, 21, 25, 32, 34. Those took us just over 3 hours. We used Aurangabad Taxis to book a taxi who were excellent service. Buy a colored booklet (do NOT pay more than 150 rps). They are available and will give you a better idea of each cave and what you'd like to visit. We skipped the guide, did our research prior and opted out of the 1200rps Go early with plenty of water (I drank 2L), with sunscreen and good walking shoes. It is hot and the people can make it even more exhausting. Find your own moments to enjoy this amazing place. Stop taking pictures for a few minutes and just observe. ??"
"A collection of 34 what is called caves carved in black stone. The caves are actually places for the monks to live and pray. As such some are huge, offering many rooms sometimes across two or even three floors. Impressive work made even more appreciated knowing power tools where not used. Some include carving of statues and shapes. If time is short follow the advice and visit the main ones: 10,12,16,21,32 & 34. With more time visit more. True that in some aspects there is a repetition yet each one has something unique."
"This was the highlight (along with Ajanta caves) of my 6 month India tour. I spent all day here, walking and hiking around the caves, visiting every one of them. I went to number 16 first, which is the highlight of all of the caves at Ajanta/Ellora, then headed over to the 1-15. I returned briefly to 16 again, before completing the rest of them. I skipped the guide and bought the small guidebook, since my guide at Ajanta only gave a partial tour, and told me pretty much all the stuff that was in the small guidebook that I had already bought. (the small guidebook covers both Ajanta and Ellora) Amazing place with great history. I flew into Aurangabad, Maharashtra on a short flight from Mumbai, and rented a car to get here. I arrived before 10am, but stayed until almost dark (after 5pm). Even the drive through the Maharashtra country-side was excellent and a welcome break from the busy city."
"The Ellora caves are near to Aurangabad compared to Ajanta. It is a combination of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu architecture. The caves are attractive, as beautiful as Ajanta. Noteworthy cave to visit is cave with a Vishnu temple."
"Ellora is located about 27 kilometers away from Aurangabad and is quite easily approachable by road. I would strongly recommend hiring a guide while visiting this area. My other recommendation is to budget about 2 - 3 hours to fully appreciate the beauty of the main temple (the Kailasha Temple) of Ellora Caves complex, the rest of the caves may be seen only if time and the fatigue factors permit. It is remarkable how a whole mountain made up of solid rock was excavated FROM THE TOP shovel-by-shovel till only the temple remained standing, surrounded by huge mountains of granite-like rock. And then would have started the sculpting on the walls of the temple to leave all those exquisite sculptures all around the temple. And finally, the artisans would have dug INSIDE the temple to prepare the sanctum santorum and its own sculptures. It is truly an amazing feat of perseverance, planning and hard work on the part of the several generations of kings and the artisans, after all, it is reputed to have taken more than a hundred years to complete! The best time to visit this place is from November till February, otherwise it can become quite hot."
"All the caves are same so just visit only the main cave which is infront of entry gate, spend your time (1-2 hrs) and move on. No need to go to Ajanta caves they are also almost same."
"Must visit caves. The carving is fundamentally different from that of Ajanta. So don't be under the impression of watching similar caves at these 2 location. You'll get to see awesome piece of art at both these locations. Road from Aurangabad is good. It takes 1 hr. If you don't have personal vehicle, hire one because Ellora caves, in parts, are located at 3 location in 2-3 kms vicinity, and you may want to visit Grishneshwar Jyotirling nearby."
"A bit of climbing and stairs involved and probably not for the elderly. We enjoyed the caves but were always surrounded by people wanting their pictures taken with us. There were about 6 buses full of local school kids and it was hard to get away from them. Now I know how Beyonce feels, it was a bit overwhelming. Lots of different rock crystal formations and geodes for sale, cool and decent pricing ( bargain hard). I regret that I didn't buy one there as they were more expensive elsewhere."
"It is said that the artisans of the Ajanta caves moved to Ellora after they abruptly stooped work at Ajanta. Chronologically these caves were built from 6th to 8th centuryAD. However, I would recommend viewing Ellora before Ajanta caves for the following reasons....While Ajanta caves have to be seen for paintings, these are famous for their sculptures. The sculptures are truly awe inspiring and breath taking. Yet, I found that the paintings and the stories they told at Ajanta touched me far more. In a way, Ellora prepared me for Aajanta .... And I don't mean to put Ellora down in the slightest. It's just that I was totally unprepared for the grandeur of Ellora and was glad I had seen it before when I saw Ajanta the next day. Now for some practical tips.... Although the entrance to the caves is near cave no. 16, please do walk east wards to cave 1 and walk back to cave 16. Caves 1,2,9,10, 12,14,15,16,29, 32 are not to be missed. Ellora caves are 28 km from Aurangabad and 10 km from Daulatabad. The access is easy and although It will take 3 hours to see them all properly, it is easier here as compared to Ajanta since they are not remotely located from the shops and parking lot. Still, do carry lots of water and some snacks. There are enough little stop areas and shady places to take a breather along the path. Enjoy!"
"This visit needs more time at least 5/6 hours, may be a day tour. If walking is a problem then autorickshaws are available. A perfect place for outing with family and friends. Architectural attraction with learning for life."
"Ellora caves is one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India and its worth going. It has Jain, Buddhist and Hindu caves. cave 16 is the best, which would take at least 3 hours if you want to explore the cave properly. The caves are famous for sculptures and paintings. Hiring a guide is must if you want to understand and do not miss anything. 1 day is must for Ellora if you want to explore all caves. ELLORA IS CLOSED ON TUESDAYS."
"This is must visit place once in a lifetime. Around 45 min from Aurangabad place, takes you back to the history. You get mesmerized by the work done 1500 years back with such precision and acute planning. Spare 4 to 5 hours along with guide to do a good justice to the visit."
"Elora is basically divided into 3 parts – Hindu caves, Budhist caves & Jain caves. The Hindu & Budhist caves are near by. The jain caves are at a little far off. Started our journey with the most famous cave in Elora – Cave No. 16 -The Kailasa Temple!! Had read lots about it on internet! But, all what i had read, hadnt prepared me for what I saw! I was totally spellbound when I entered this cave!! Ok, so we all knew that its made out of a single rock, it uses rock cut method – A large quantity of rock was scooped out & a single piece was left. Also, the sculptors started their work from top & then did the lower parts. Its supposedly the biggest monolithic structure present in the world. Also, it was made using simple chisel & hammer. It took supposedly 100 yrs! I salute those architects, sculptors & each & every worker who was involved in building this! At the entrance, there is a Ganesha's statue on one side, Durga at the other & Lakshmi at the front. Just like we start all our work worshipping Lord Ganesha, the same has been followed here! The Durga sculpture is in the famous pose of killing the demon Mahishasura. The Lakshmi sculpture is very special – thanx to the detailed information given by our guide uncle. The Lakshmi is sitting on lotus leaves & there are 4 elephants – 2 on each side. The lower elephants seem to be taking water in the trunk & passing it on the upper ones, who in turn pour it on the Goddess. There is a tall pillar inside – again made of single rock. The temple is basically divided into 2 parts – one main temple sculpture & the other is the surrounding wall. We first went through the outer wall area. It has many different sculptures of Shiva & Parvati in different scenarios. The guide explained many of them to us. One of the most significant one I remember is the one in which Shiva & Parvati are playing some game. There is a sculpture of Ravana trying to lift mount Kailasa in the wall of the main temple. Looking at it, gives us an idea of how strong Ravana might have been. The part of the temple wall facing south has depictions of Ramayana(since Ramayana happened in South India) & the northern wall has of Mahabharatha(War was fought in North India)! The one in which Jatayu tries to stop Ravana is still fresh in memory (though m writing it after 5 months). The lower part of the temple wall has sculptures of elephants – it actually gives a feeling that they are holding the weight of the temple. Then, we climbed up the stairs & reached the main temple - where the idol is kept, There is a huge nandi statue. There is a hige Shivling inside the temple. After worshipping, we came out & took snaps from this first floor. I really wished that I could spend more time in this amazing temple. This was perhaps the first time that I have felt so much positivity in a place. A big thanks to the artisans of those days to create such a n amazing masterpiece! We later visited the budhishts caves. These caves had small rooms at the outer walls of the caves, which were rest rooms for the monks. One of the best one was cave 10 – having a big statue of budha in front of a big stupa. The guide had given us details about the different postures of Budha & also the different hand postures of Budha. Cave 10's uniqueness was the style used in designing the roof – it looked like curved ribs. We later visited few of the other budhist caves & then moved on towards the car. The Jain caves were at a distance, so had to take car there. The Jain caves have the statues of Mahavir Jain in different postures. One of the cave was 2 storeyed & had a narrow staircase. We then thanked our guide & left Elora – with a hope in mind that i will be able to visit it again!"
"Trip to Aurangabad is not considered complete if one has not visited this place comprising of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain rock cut cave temples. These caves are a masterpiece of architecture for their intricate rock carvings and delightful throw of colours in paintings done on ceilings and walls, which has withstood time and the atrocious period under the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb. These caves were built under the dynastic rule of Rashrakutas (of South India) and are about 1000-1500 years old and are listed as one of the world heritage sites in India. It is recommended to take a guide, as in a casual visit one would not understand interesting aspects of these cave temples, the mythological significance of idols and the history behind. But be careful to hire services of a government certified guide from the ticket counter. We hired the services of a very good English speaking guide (Mr. Thomas), who had immense knowledge about these caves and really made our visit purposeful. With his knowledge he could extract a lot of interest in us. He started our visit from the Jain temple caves on the left, then led us to the Hindu temples in the center (most notable of these was the Kailasha temple) and lastly, the Buddhist caves on the right. The Jain caves are mostly illustrative of figurines of the Digambara sect and the Jain Tirthankars. The Hindu temples focused on Lord Shiva, incarnations of Lord Vishnu and depiction of sequences from Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Buddhist caves depict life phases of Lord Buddha up to his enlightenment. These Buddhist caves also had monastery for scholars at that time and also served as a residential campus of learning. The Kailasha (Hindu) temple was carved from one large monolithic rock. It is unique, as the whole temple is carved out from mountain top leading to the base, which is amazing work, something to compare with the Petra. It is a place worth visiting, as it illustrates our rich heritage and beautifully depicts our unity in diversity. Do carry sufficient drinking water inside, as the walk from one cave to another can become tiring. Food vendors are not allowed within. There are some vendors who sell pieces of quartz, corals, amethyst etc. taken out from nearby mines. These are reasonable good we found out. Stone jewellery is also something which is sold by vendors if one is interested to buy. The entire campus is very well kept to preserve history."
"I found 3 faiths sculpture in same area Buddhism, Hinduism n Jainisum. After seeing Ajanta Caves I didn't find Buddhist caves very impressive. Still Cave 10 is unique as you can see both sects impression in sculpture n can hear dholl sound in Cave 10. Cave 16 n 29 is very impressive for n shows sculpture of Hindu maithology. Cave 32 of Jainisum is very interesting. You can spend hole day depending upon your interest n energy level. If you read about the caves you don't need guide. Better to buy book or see video before visit. Goverment guide will take you so fast n will not provide enough information. It's better if you find some local guide around. We were lucky to have them. There is no good restaurant in campus. Near by best Choice is Kailash restaurant which is your best patients which is also so so."
"This is around 30 km away from Aurangabad and the road is bad. We hired an auto rickshaw and driver took @INR 800 to cover the place along with some other places like Daulatabad Fort, Bibi-ka-Maqbara etc. There are 34 caves Cave number 1-12 are Buddhist cave. Cave number 13-19 are Hindu caves. Cave number 30-34 are Jain caves. The top attraction is Cave-16 or Kailasa temple which is in front of the gate and always crowded. This temple complex is entirely carved out of the adjoining hill and took 200 years. If you visit this cave first then all other caves will look pretty dull. Better start from cave 1. To cover all the caves you have to walk a long distance, 4-5km. Some auto rickshaws are available who take INR 150 to cover some of the caves (mainly 28-34). Paintings are less compared to Ajanta but sculptures are really magnificent. It may take 3-4 hours to cover all the caves and also depends on how much time you want to spend on cave 16."
Cave number 1-12 are Buddhist cave. Cave number 13-19 are Hindu caves. Cave number 30-34 are Jain caves. There is a waterfall running above the cave at the area of cave 1-6 and it's pretty amazing
It was soooo beautiful.. loved every bit of it.. its a showcase of beautiful art made thousands of years ago.. so much hard work is required to build such a huge thing.. i wish i could knw more about the artist.. everything is beautiful about the place
What a fantastic place to visit.... big huge mountain caves.... thrilled to see it... Some construction work is still going on.... Nominal enterance fee of Rs. 10/-.... Guides are also available at the enterance gate for Rs. 1000/- but its better to hire the autorickshaw for a nominal fee of Rs. 150/- by which u can explore lot of caves in minimum time. Expected time taken to explore the caves is 2-3 hours.
Idle stay should at Aurangabad and you can stay in Lemontree or Rama international if you have specific taste for food and budget. You can find a lot of cabs to rent for a day trip. Ellora is 29 KMs from the city and you can start early to reach before the crowd. Researchers can stay close to the caves (there is a hotel to stay). Closed on Tuesdays. There is approx 34 caves as i recollect to visit and some of the caves are little far and small cars are available inside to take you around on chargeable basis (not sure if they are still there). Kailash temple is a splendid work i carry in memories. Each cave is beyond the present day craftsmen skill sets.
"It takes no more than 40 minutes to go by taxi from Aurangabad. Some cave with doors closed but you can still get inside. For cave 29, 30~34 you should take taxi there. Cave 32 is worth a glimpse. (You can book taxi for two days for 3600Rs in airport including the site : Ajanta, Ellora, Daulatabad, Bibi ka maqbara and other site in the town)"
"I presume if you are reading this then you must be interested in historical sites, in which case the Ellora caves is a must. It is just over 30 minutes drive from Aurungabad and a hired taxi cost us 1600 rupees. Having been to Petra in Jordan, I subjectively think this is even greater even though the initial impact Petra has on you is greater. There are 34 caves, sprawled out over a couple of kilometres but your taxi can drive you to both ends to lessen the walk. One could spend the better part of the day exploring all 34 but I think you can give at least 10 of them a miss as there is a great deal of repeation. Give yourself at least 3 to 4 hours to do it some justice. Guides are available for just over 1000 rupees at the entrance."
"Its an archaeological site approx 30 km from Aurangabad. There are total 34 monumental caves out of which 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12), 17 Hindu (caves 13–29) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves. Out of these, best one id Cave no 16 , The Kailash Temple. Cave no 10 & 32-34 are must visit along with this. These caves shows Indian Rock-cut architecture & represents religious harmony of Indian History We used our car to reach all caves, Autos are also available. Car & Autos are allowed upto parking, from there u have to take stroll to reach different caves. More than 4 hours are required to cover all caves."
No proper Toilet facilities. Cannot believe why basic amenities like clean toilets/Washrooms and clean eating places are not provided at the tourist sites. Why cant Govt involve private entrepreneurs to offer such amenities at reasonable cost?
"Ellora caves are amazing. Especially hindu complex can take a breathe away. i was really impressed also by jain caves. Well, you should go and see by yourself. Again arrange your trip ie car with the driver as not al the caves are in the same place . Jain ones are 4 km from hindu and buddism complexes. fortunately no circus with shuttle bus (ajanta case ) . buy a ticket 250 INR and hire the official guide. 2-3h visit 1035 INR. Enjoy!!!"
"It was my desire as a student of history to visit Ajanta & Ellora caves in Maharashtra, India. Ellora is a site of outstanding cave temples, datable between ad 575 and the end of the 9th century...The caves were excavated from volcanic rock along a 2-km stretch of west-facing embankment. There are 34 major caves, numbered consecutively rather than chronologically, starting with the Buddhist group (Caves 1-13) in the south. Other groups are dedicated to the Brahmanical pantheon (Caves 14-29) and to Jainism (Caves 30-34). The most notable monument is Cave 16, the Kailasa Temple, which represents the culmination of rock-cut architecture, with huge sculptural reliefs heightening the overall symbolism of the temple as cosmic mountain and as the home of Shiva. The visit to these caves is enjoyed maximum during monsoon, when every stream is filled with rainwater, and the entire environ is lush green. The caves are hewn out of the volcanic basaltic formation of Maharasthra, known as ‘Deccan Trap’, the term trap being of Scandinavian origin representing the step like formation of the volcanic deposits. At Ellora, one can also have a glimpse of the channels (near Cave 32) through which the volcanic lava once flowed. These channels, due to overheating, have a characteristic brownish red colour. A tourist can plan the visit of these caves according to the time available and depending upon the interest in ancient art. A minimum of 4 hours and Maximum of endless time...Open from sunrise to sunset...And Closed on Tuesday"
"in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India are about 29 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments which date from the 2nd century BCE to about 480 or 650 CE."
Ellora has two things working very well for it- 1. Its proximity to Aurangabad city and 2. The main monolithic cave which is extremely beautiful . I loved the caves here and would love to come back
"We a group of Sri Lankan friends were in northern India in a Buddhist Pilgrimage from 28/02 to 14/03, 2015. Our last destination was Ellora, only seconded to Ajantha caves we visited previously. These also same as man made caves with lots of sculptures and carvings all are finished looks very smooth and alive. In some caves we observed some colorful paintings, though now it was faded, still imaging how amusing they were. The first cave we meets is represent Hindunism while all others represents three different religious creeds, viz., Buddhism, Brahmanism and Jainism. They said that there are nearly 100 caves in the this hilly area but there are 34 famous caves which we visited. We we informed that there are 12 Buddhist Caves 16 Brahmanical and Caves 4 Jaina caves. As Buddhists we closely observed those caves and found that they were amazing. Some caves consists with two or three floors, all were carved in to the rock and combined with smooth rock stairways. The life of Buddha, Jathaka Stories and Buddhism represents all the statues, sculptures and carvings. we enjoyed lot by visiting this place same as Ajantha. I recommend this place is very important and worth to visit, but may more lovely in early hours than evening, that we did, as it was very hot and make us tired soon. Don't forget to get a ticket for your camera/video cam. Also you must remove shoes before enter to Buddhist caves."
"In view of the heat and the distance between caves, a tuktuk is a sound idea. The caves are lovely and the carvings are amazing. Some of the caves are vast and it seems impossible that they were excavated all those years ago."
"it is set three kinds sculptures of budhism Jainism and Hinduism. It is better if you visit only a few caves like 9,15,16. It is indeed worth seeing. it is only half an hours journey from Aurangabad."
"This World heritage site should not be missed by any traveler to India. Untoughed by the invaders from the West and north, this is some awe inspiring art created over 2000 years ago."
"There are total 34 no of caves here, each one is unique, please spent a whole day here if you have deep interest in sculptures. cave no 1 & 34 have breath taking beauty in rock carvings, do take a guide if you want to know the detail of every carving. A must visit once in a lifetime master piece created by our ancestors."
Ellora Caves were some of the best things I have seen in a while. This is high praise considering I have been travelling constantly for the past five months. The carvings are magnificent. Cave 16 is a work of art. I cannot even imagine how it was dreamed up and executed. The Ellora complex combined with the Ajanta Caves make this area a must visit in India.
"There ae a total of 34 caves and if you visit each and every cave then one whole day is required. Cave No.16 with the kailasa temple , largest monolithic temple in the world' is the main attraction. Cave Nos. 29,21 to 24 etc are also good! suggested not to visit in summer. The total distance may be around 5 kms. In case you have elderly persons/ ids who find difficult to walk, there are autorickshaws offering to take you to a ""guided tour"" of important caves for Rs.250/- for an auto (4-6 people an sit in the auto as per your group). You an also take your vehcile upto some of the caves."
"As the title above suggests, these caves are undoubtedly the architectural wonders of the World.It is indeed very difficult to grasp how those masters of art, architecture and sculpture could create these works of excellence with primitive tools and tackles!!These are the largest monolithic single rock cut structures in the World.The most magnificent cave--cave no 26 popularly known as Kailash temple is cut vertically from a single rock and is a three storied building full of marvelous sculptures depicting the life and activity of Lord Shiva You should take the help of a qualified guide who will explain every interesting details There are a total of 34 caves built between 5th- 7th century and contains Hindu, Buddhist and Jain temples. Caves 1-12 are Buddhist temples, 13-29 are Hindu temples and 30-34 are Jain temples.Unlike Ajanta caves, these caves were never"" rediscovered"" but were being worshiped by devotees continuously over the ages and as such are in much better condition.As expected, it is an UNESCO World heritage site..As mentioned earlier, cave no 26 is the largest monolithic rock cut structure in the World and is double the size of Pantheon in Athens This Kailash temple has been built to resemble it to the Himalayas which is believed to be abode of Lord Shiva. Moreover,it was given a coat of white plaster to resemble snow covered mountains of Himalaya. Unbelievable!!!.Buddhist caves are also multi storied having Chaityas or rooms for worship. Viharas or monasteries, rest room ,bed rooms,kitchen,long corridors decorated wit very beautiful ornate sculptures. One cave has a 15 feet long statue of Lord Buddha in a preaching style Combination of these Hindu.Buddhist and Jain temple built closely reflect the religious tolerance prevailing in ancient India.Of course,many Hindu gods and goddesses are seen in Buddhist and JAIN temples as well. Please bear in mind that Ellora is closed to public on tuesdays. there is an entrance fee of Rs 10 for Indian and citizens of SAARC countries and Rs 250 for foreigners.Opening time is from 9 am t 5 pm It is about 30 km or 1hour away from AURANGABAD which is the nearest place to stay having many 5 star to budget hotels.Conducted tours are organized by many tour operators.However, we being back packers had hired a autorickshaw with a bargained rate of Rs 600.We went out at 7-30 am and went staraight to ELLORA,stayed for about 4 hours,and visited Auranzebs tomb,Daulatabad fort, Grishneswar temple,and pan chakki while returning. one thing you remember---since Ellora caves ,unlike Ajanta are scattered over an area,dont let the auto rickshaw release you near the ticket counter as he will like to do but insist him to take you inside and again take you to other caves located on the other side of the wash room There is only one wash room located behind the ticket counter which is reasonably clean. Please carry water bottle and a wide brimmed hat to withstand the tropical Sun. We went in end November, still lit was very tiresome to walk for 4 hours. You may take some snacks with you from Aurangabad which will come handy as you are bound to feel hungry after walking a long distance At the end,I bowed my head with awe and respect to my master ancestors of art, architecture and sculpture who created these timeless wonderful works so many years ago!! Many of the structures were also painted as is evident from faint trace of paints still existing I have tried to mention the details needed by a tourist to visit Ellora comfortably and if my review proves to be any help to you, please do not forget to give me a helpful vote Last piece of advice---please do not try to cover AJjanta and Ellora in a single day as you you will not be able to enjoy either of the two and remember that Ajanta is closed on mondays Now that my sermon is over,please visit Ellora and enjoy!! Enjoy your trip to Ellora and dont club it with Ajanta tour as you will not enjoy either of the two."
"The review is largely about the the Kailas temple and the adjacent Dasavatara caves. I was staying close by at Hotel Kailas. So, I would start early morning at quarter past six to reach the caves as soon as it opens at 6.30am. Difficult to describe the feeling as you soak in the grandeur of these two caves when there is nobody else around and the light is weak. You get a strange spine tingling sensation of awe - gazing at the creativity, scale and tenacity of thousands long lost craftsmen chiseling away over centuries. The silence also scared me as you are surrounded by armies of live sized stone elephants carrying Mount Kailash on their shoulders- almost all other statues are more than life sized. The second morning, I climbed on top of the hill overlooking the Kailash temple (from which the temple was hewn) - with nobody else around. Again the same feeling - awe and fright. A huge horde of langur ran up in a file on the path behind me - harmless and in their own games. But I could not stay up any longer - the surreal setting was too much in the haunting cavalcade of the langur file. Never had this sensation anywhere else in the world."
"Ellora is 35 kms far from airport. It's a beautiful place to visit. You can take auto or car to reach this place. There are many caves spread around 3 kms. If you can walk then it's okay otherwise you need Transport to go from one cave to another. If you go to aurangabad, it's a must visit place."
I visited caves at last month. I was very beautiful and shining. I forgot about the outside world when I noticing the caves. Such a great structure I saw in my entire life is one of the memorable moment in my life. I feel myself lucky to see those rocking structures.
"The caves are divided into 3 areas, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism. It is going to take more than 3 hrs to finish off all the caves, luckily and unlikely u can take your vehicles near to few of the caves so that you can finish it off faster. The master piece is the Kailash temple. The whole temple is carved from the rocky mountain. Once such wonder that was bulit before centuries. One can find the mastery in Dravidian architecture, by seeing the pillar at the entrance of the temple and the bridge connecting. It is not easy to carve from the mountain. Lots of engineering work was behind this masterpiece"
"Did a large circuit in the NW part of Aurangabad. Ellora caves are 30 Kim's from Aurangabad. Scenic drive through brush land and high plateau. The entrance to the caves is right by the drop off point. Entry tickets can be purchased at the entrance for Rs250 as a non citizen. They are Rs10 for Indian citizens. I would recommend doing some basic reading before visiting. Try to get there early to avoid the crowds. There are 2 sets of caves, 1-16 and then 17-29. Start on the right of the entrance at cave 1 and make your way back. Wear comfortable footwear and bring water. Limit the amount of stuff you carry as the day can begin to get hot. I was here in March and the afternoon was in the nineties. Lots of hawkers selling souvenirs. If you do not wasn't them do not engage in a discussion, just say ""next time"" and keep walking. Highly recommend. The difference between these and Ajanta caves is that the latter are in color and in my opinion even better."
I could not see much of the place as we reached there a bit late and the place closes at 6pm. Also it was raining that day and place looked even better.
you can't see everything in one day....but whatever you see is just a brilliant display of sculpture...
its one of the oldest and famous caves of aurangabad. better than ajanta's. but some part are really dangerous to go due to lack of security
"If Taj-Mahal is Diamond of India,then Ellora is Diamond Mine! There are total 34 caves divided in 3 groups According to religion-Buddhism,Hindu and Jain in this order..I think no other place in world where religious structures of 3 faiths stood together in harmony and eternal beauty! A tourist can plan the visit of these caves according to the time available and depending upon the interest in ancient art. If a visitor has at his disposal three to four hours, then the Cave nos. 10 (Visvakarma Cave), 16 (Kailasa), 21 (Ramesvara) and 32 & 34 (Jaina group of caves) should not be missed. Thus, by visiting these caves, one can have a glimpse of the representative art of Buddhism, Brahmanism and Jainism. If a visitor has an entire day at his disposal, the Cave nos. 2, 5, 10 & 12 of the Buddhist group; Cave nos. 14, 15, 16, 21 & 29 of the Brahmanical group and Caves 32 to 34 of the Jaina group should be visited. Since these caves are spread over more than 2 Kms one can drive own vehicle or hire an auto which takes about ? 100-150 as fare.There are official guides who charges about ? 1035 for all the caves but one can choose guide only for 2 most important caves ,cave no 16 ,the Kailash Cave a master art of all caves and a wonder as this cave is build from Top to bottom,defying all rules of modern civil engineering and Cave no 21 the Rameshwara cave dedicated to marriage of Lord Shiva and Godess Parvati.For cave no 16 one can bargain for ? 300 as guide fee and for cave 21 ? 100. Rather than going for cave no 16 which in front as one enters cave complex ,one should start from cave 21,then to caves no 32-34 and go to cave no 16 and then walk to cave no 10,5 and if you visit these caves it will suffice as rest of caves have replicas of these caves."
"Ellora cave's are 29 Kms north-west of Aurangabad by road.The cave complex consists of a total of 34 monasteries and temples excavated from Volcanic rock over a 2 Km stretch of embankment.The hills in which these caves are excavated forms part of the Sahyadri mountains.Unlike the Ajanta caves the caves of Ellora were never lost or forgotten in history since they existed on the popular trade route.During 19th century these caves were owned by the Holkar rulers of Indore who leased these caves for worship.After the Holkars these caves came into the possession of the Nizam of Hyderabad who carried out extensive maintenance and repair of these caves through the Archaeological department of India. The caves are numbered consecutively rather than chronologically for the benefit of tourists and historians .The same is shown in the ""Plan Diagram"" with the Buddhist caves (1-13 ) in the South followed by the Brahmanical caves(14-29) and the last being the Jain caves (30-34).The most significant aspect of these caves is that they show the religious tolerance of this particular era. At the entrance itself is ""Cave 16"" which houses the World's largest monolithic rock cut temple., the ""KAILASA TEMPLE"".The ""Kailasa Temple"" has been excavated and cut from a mountain beginning from the top to the bottom .From Kailasa Temple and the Buddhist caves a tourist has to walk almost 2 Kms to the other extreme end to visit the ""Jain Caves"". Travel by vehicle within the cave complex is possible from a outer road rather than walking the same distance."
The Ellora caves are really spectacular - a must see. Check out my review on the Ajanta and Ellora page.
The caves are very impressive. I travelled from Aurangabad (staying in Panchavati hotel) in a taxi hired for a daily rate of R1250. A highlight of India! Recommended!
"Ellora caves are much more recent than Ajanta and hence depict much more defined sculptures. Each cave is on a grand scale and every rock cut is more intricate and elaborate. With a total of 34 caves, the first 16 can be covered on foot together, with cave no #16 being the epitome. Private cars can be taken to the remaining caves. There are small stalls available for food on the way but they offer mostly snacks. Cave #29 is also a must see. Maintenance of these caves however is an issue. Though these are in pretty good condition currently, they are left wide open to the tourists with little monitoring. Children and even adults sitting on the Buddha statues for pics was pretty disheartening to see, as was the absence of guards. Some of the caves were bat infected, which might damage the archaeological site. While in Ellora, also visit close sites like Grishneshwar Temple (less than a Km), Aurangzeb's Tomb (very simple) and the Daulatabad Fort which are all en-route Aurangabad."
"I would highly recommend to those who want to understand and relish the great Indian architecture built between 6th-9th century, which still prevails. Believe me, it won't disappoint you a bit. I was struck in awe looking at the magnificent temple built for Hindu, Buddha and Jain Gods. It speaks about the passion and dedication of those artisans who built this monolithic structures with very minimal tools. There were no machinery or any automated tools during that time and you can imagine how skilful our older generations with the engineering skills. Before you go, please read the history of Ellora in wiki and you will be able to appreciate it more when you visit! Best time to visit : Oct - Feb How to reach: Aurangabad is the nearest city. There are trains from Mumbai or Pune to reach Aurangabad. If you arrive Aurangabad, there are several good travel operators who run a package to take you Ellora and Ajanta. Travel Operator: We engaged Hussain a travel operator from Aurangabad who is very polite, knowledgeable and resourceful. I highly recommend his services who would like to visit Ellora-Ajanta-Aurangabad. Where to Eat: I found Vrindavan Resorts and Lodging about to 1 or 2 KMs on the highway is a very decent place to eat vegetarian food. He can be reached at 8855835494. Other places to see near Ellora: Grishnewar Jyotirling Temple, Aurangbad city, Daulatabad Fort."
"Crowded, can be managed better. But obviously a must visit for history lovers. The caves are many in numbers if you have your own vehicle ask him to take you to various caves, if not then the local rickshaws would take you as per person Rs 70-100. The MTDC hotel out there is expensive with limited food options. Try to see if you can get food elsewhere as we reached down at 4 and had limited options to search since ppl where very hungry"
"Located about 30 Km from Aurangabad, are the Ellora caves, locally known as ‘Verul Leni’ or Elura, both corruptions of its ancient name of Elapura. While the beauty of Ajanta Caves’ lies in their famed paintings and murals, Ellora’s wealth lies in the caves sculptures and rich architecture. Here the 34 rock cut monasteries and temples, dug side by side in the wall of a high basalt cliff and extending for more than 2 km, are a celebration of 3 major Indian religions – Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The Ellora monuments date between 6th and 10th centuries, hewn on the Sahyadri ranges of India’s Deccan Plateau dated to the Cretaceous era (about 65 million years ago). The signature cave of Ellora is the monolithic Kailasa temple (Cave 16), the largest single monolithic excavation in the world. It is also the busiest with maximum visitors. We spent a full day in Ellora. The caves we liked best were Cave nos. 2, 5, 10 & 12 of the Buddhist group; Cave nos. 14, 15, 16, 21 & 29 of the Hindu group and Caves 32 to 34 of the Jain group If a visitor has only 3 to 4 hours I would recommend the following as must visit Cave nos. 10 (Visvakarma Cave) : An ultimate example of Buddhist Chaitya in India with 30 pillars. For the discerned, a comparison between this Chaitya and the Cave 19 of Ajanta would give interesting differences. Cave 15 (Dasa Avtar): The top floor has wonderful sculptures on either side of a great hall, mainly of incarnations of Vishnu and forms of Shiva. Cave 16 (Kailasa): The massive structure was hewn from a mass of rock by cutting 3 trenches on 3 sides of the hill, an audacious feat which took more than 200 years to complete. Take the flight of stairs outside the temple on the left and climb up to get fantastic views of the entire complex Cave 21 (Ramesvara): The cave has a beautiful façade, supported by beautifully engraved pillars and pilasters. Outside the cave, on the sidewalls are figures of River Goddesses Ganga and Yamuna. Cave 32 (Jain Group): A good 3 Km from cave 21, take a auto rickshaw to visit the Jain group of caves. This ride would cost you around 250 rupees. This two tiered cave is locally known as “Indra Sabha”, has a resemblance to Cave 16, Kailasa at first sight Cave 34 (Jain group): The last cave and is actually linked to Cave 32. Has nice sculptures on the top floor. Try to reach early in the morning to beat the crowds. You can also see the structures come alive with the rising sun."
Ellora caves are a marvelous example of ancient Indian architecture.A complete day is required for visting these caves.Autos and vans are available which can be hired to ply between the caves.Food and water available but very expensive.Cameras are a must for this place to capture the wonderful sculptures.I was completely mesmerized by this place.Shoes suitable for trekking are a must.Torch light is also necessary as there are many dark places inside the caves having wonderful sculptures and carvings.It would be very inspiring if history of the place is known (through browsing) before visiting.
"Ellora caves are a mere 30km from Aurangabad and the roads are good. The caves are spread over 4kms and are accessible by vehicle upto a point near each cluster of caves. The caves are clean, only some of the darker caves have a faint smell, but are well maintained otherwise. it is recommended to see atleast 1 or 2 caves from each cluster, but Cave 16 is hard to ignore and the best. The Kailasa temple is an architectural marvel and the best views are from climbing the hillock behind the temple!"
"yes its a world heritage site that simply has to be visited.. you would be blow away seeing the kailash temple, the 3 floor monasteries.. and the amazing history behind the place.. but here is something more for you.. dont hire the guides if you have kids.. as kids dont have patience.. majority of what the guides will tell you is already there in the guide books, so if you have time , go through the books on your own and then discover the caves on your own, that my friend is much better.. although being a world heritage site, the bathrooms are toilets are the worst possible.. everybody in and around the caves is looking at making a fast buck.. so be careful..you definitely need more than half a day to explore the cave.. and usually everybody just see the kailsah temple and move back.. dont do that.."
"Elora caves are 34 caves rock cut shrines that represents 3 religions in India - Buddhist, Hindu and Jain. The main cave is a replica of Lord Shiva´s celestial abode. It is impressive. Be prepared to walk."
"We did a day trip to Ellora caves in combination with the temple and fort in the area. We hired a driver as the local tourist bureau wasn't running one that day. We spend a couple of hours at the caves. They are great but I thought Ajanta was a bit more impressive...they seemed to be better maintained and more restoration has gone into them. That said, Ellora is certainly worth a stop!"
"When you enter cave 16, it seems like the place is alive! The majestic sculptures and the sheer magnificence of the 'cave' enthrals the visitor transporting him into a different world. It is a huge temple carved out of a mountain, a truly mystifying, humbling and a divine experience...not to be missed!!!!"
"the ellora caves are a must see , atleast once in a lifetime. They are so nicely carved caves with some beautiful temples inside with sculptures of gods. You need more than a day to completely explore the entire ellora caves. there were great monuments every where, but very poorly maintained. many of the sculptures are broken. lions/elephants sculptures are broken to half in few places. As the same many of the sculptures were not in condition. No proper lighting inside the caves. you will be left in pitch dark even during day times. there is no proper guidance for way/path if you are going with out a guide. Most of the caves smell foul and many people are not able to bare the bad smell over there. Not sure from where the bad smell is emerging. beware : there were huge number of owls inside of few caves which are not visible until you go inside and see with some light/torch. its a bit dangerous if they are disturbed. there were in huge number in one of dark cave. its a bit difficult to walk for multiple caves if you are on a short trip. so better engage a vehicle to make it a quicker one. but if you want to enjoy the caves completely then its better you take an auto rikshaw over there who generally rip off tourists. you need to firm and knowledgeable over here."
"Last Visited : October 2013 How to Reach: We reached from our hotel by cab , @ 1050/- total cost, as it was required to cover a packed whole day tour Daulatabad Fort -> Grineshwar Temple -> Illora -> Aurangazeb's tomb -> Bibi Ka Mukbara -> Panchakki. Also City tour bus @ 300 per head cost an alternate option. Site Review : Ellora is an archaeological site, 29 km (18 mi) North-West of the city of Aurangabad in the Indian state of Maharashtra built by the Rashtrakuta dynasty. Well known for its monumental caves, Ellora is a World Heritage Site. Ellora represents the epitome of Indian rock-cut architecture. Historical Information: It is also known as Elapura (in the Rashtrakuta literature-Kannada). The 34 ""caves"" are actually structures excavated out of the vertical face of the Charanandri hills. Buddhist, Hindu and Jain rock-cut temples and viharas and mathas were built between the 5th century and 10th century. The 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12), 17 Hindu (caves 13–29) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves, built in proximity, demonstrate the religious harmony prevalent during this period of Indian history. It is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. Additional Observation: Ellora occupies a relatively flat region of the Western Ghats. Ancient volcanic activity in this area created many layered basalt formations, known as Deccan Traps. During the Cretaceous, one such volcanic hill formed on the southwest-facing side of Ellora. Its vertical face made access to many layers of rock formations easier, enabling architects to pick basalt with finer grains for more detailed sculpting. Localities & Food : Must carry bottle of water, A lot of small restaurants, within reasonable price near Illora Caves. Must use shoe as it a busy day to cover all sites. run run run.. to cover all locations.... Hotels : We stayed at Hotel Panchavati during this visit, a budget hotel but neat & clean. Food also well cooked and a nearby Mela also added spice during our journey. Contact Details: Hotel Panchavati - 9890340816 Ashoka Tour & Travels for City Tour - 9890340816"
Visit to Ellora was a good experience. there are good no of restaurants and dhabas outside. But what stood out was the restaurant of MTDC inside the campus near the gate. Very good food and service. You can take your cars inside the ellora area and visit the caves.
"Ellora is a perfect destination, but in the rains and winter. The summer out here will drain u. The Kailash resort barely 200 meters from the caves entry gate is a lovely place to stay. The cottages face the famous Sita ki Nahani water fall.. and give u a lovely view of the hills and caves all around."
"If your in Aurangabad, this is one place you don't want to miss. The caves are just 29kms from the city and you can easily get there by a private vehicle There is an entry fee to get into the caves but its very minimal.. There are plenty of caves to look around ( although smaller than the Ajanta caves) but none the less very well magnificently sculpted. There are a number of restaurants nearby to enjoy a traditional Maharashtrian meal. You can choose to pack some lunch but beware of the monkeys. Tour guides are also available on request."
"Superbly built. All the temples have been carved out of a hill. Such minute carvings in fine details, standing the test of time. The whole place leaves you mesmerised. Especially, the grand Hindu temple of Lord Shiva , which is carved out of one single rock is very beautiful. The caves reminds of our rich history and architectural grandeur we Indians had achieved centuries ago."
"The caves are truly a phenomenon and cannot be missed on your visit to the city of gates (Aurangabad). Not all caves are important, so please ensure to buy or carry a guide book to ensure that you visit the important caves. Do not opt for a guide as information is widely available on the internet or in the guide books that you can purchase from the government stalls located either at Ajanta or Ellora. Be aware that Summers are intense and it is very important to carry ample water supply and a hat or umbrella. Sun tan lotion might do good."
"Excellent caves near aurangabad.In a single place we can find hindu bodhha and jain caves.Elora caves is famous for stone sculpture.Kailash temple situated in one of the caves is one of the greatest architectural monument in India.The whole temple is carved out from a single stone.It took hundreds of year by artist to complete the caves.If you are in maharastra ,do take out few days and visit ellora."
"Very nice place to visit.Got to know many things about which we have only studied.Spreaded on large area.Caves are good,many of them are finished,some of them are unfinished.But its really a nice place."
"The magnificent rock cut temple complex of Ellora, is another world heritage site, 30 kilometers from Aurangabad. It is believed that the Buddhist monks, after Ajanta, brought the artisans to Ellora, followed by the Hindu kings and finally the Jain saints , so that the caves numbering 34, unlike in Ajanra, are arranged chronologically - the first 12 are Buddhist ,, the central 17 are Hindu ,and the last 5 are Jain caves, the monuments extending in a linear row from south to north ; an excellent example of the harmony that existed between the three major faiths. These caves are in fact rock cut temples excavated from the vertical face of the hills. The parking site is pretty and green with beautifully landscaped grounds. Amod,our guide , started from the last cave, no.34, a Jain temple. The similarity in iconography to Buddhist sculpture is obvious, the jain saints of Ellora temples who belonged to the most ascetic digambhara sect, can be recognized by their nudity. Cave 34 communicates through a rock cut gateway to cave no 32, the best example of jain temple at Ellora,. It is a two storey structure , wrongly called the Indra sabha due to the presence of yakshas associated with god indra. The upper hall is full of exquisite sculptures on the walls, pillars and recesses , the largest lotus adorning the ceiling and all the pillars exhibiting exquisite artistry. Here one can see images of Mahavira, the 24th saint ,the founder of Jainism. After a short walk Amod took us to cave no 16, celebrated as the Kailasha, shiva’s abode in the lofty mountains. Regarded as the greatest monolithic structure in the world ,it is also the grandest and the most magnificent among the caves of Ellora. Its awe inspiring immensity, its graceful sculptures , and its architectural grandeur, leaves one spellbound –and speechless. Working from the top to excavate the rock mass to convert it into a cathedral of stone is an awesome, incredulous task. A two storey gateway leads into a U-shaped courtyard edged with galleries three stories high with intricately carved panels, and alcoves for sculptures galore. Three structures dominate the courtyard, the first is a huge nandi- bull, vehicle of shiva ,the second is a large hall-mandapam- housing a huge stone lingam, symbolic of shiva. The third are the life size elephants carved to create a suggestion of holding aloft the mandapam. There are two captivating Panels on the side walls, illustrating the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata in brief. While all the other caves have deities, mostly shiva, two notable caves are no.15, where large panels illustrate themes associated with the ten avatars of Vishnu -dashavatara cave. In Cave no. 21, there are figurines of river goddess Ganga and Yamuna. Among the Buddhist caves, caves1-9 are viharas ,the last 2 caves,no.11, do tal-two storey, no12 ,teen tal, 3 storey caves. The only chaitya cave ,cave 10, , known as the carpenter;s cave, is a Buddhist cathedral ,the vaulted ceiling intricately carved to give the impression of ribbed wooden beams, a colossal 15 feet statue of Buddha seated in the preaching pose in front of a stupa. The amazing acoustic clarity of the prayer hall was demonstrated by Amod whose full recitation of ‘Buddham Saranam Gacchami’, reverberating through the hall, was heard by everyone present in pin drop silence. What a fitting finale to a memorable visit to a magnificent monument! If you are visiting both the Ajanta and Ellora caves, choose to go to the Ajanta caves first, so that when you visit the Ellora caves the next day, you may conveniently skip most of the Buddhist caves except cave no 10. Be prepared for a long walk, carry a bottle of water, wear a cap, and a comfortable pair of walking shoes. Preferably start from the jain caves and afterwards straightaway go to cave 16, the kailash temple , where you need to spend maximum time. Remember that the caves are closed on Tuesdays. And engaging a professional guide will make the visit interesting and worthwhile."
"We recently visited the dusty city of Aurangabad. The city is very dusty with bad roads. But the way to Ellora was a pleasant surprise. Due to lack of time we skipped Ajanta and focused on Ellora which is around 30 kms from Aurangabad. Though there are no restaurants at Ellora, there are quite a few on the way there. They not really restaurants but roadside dhabbas. For a change you can try the street food, tastewise quite good. Ok now to the caves. We were again so pleasantly surprised to see the clean and green surrounding of the place. Must say the state Government has done a good job in maintaining this heritage site.The entry is only Rs.10/- with good parking space for vehicles. Just beware of the monkeys around. We parked our car bang below a tree only to be huddled by the monkeys on the roof. My car roof had quite a few dents which cost me a bunch to fix. No complaints..we took it in our stride as the kids thoroughly enjoyed seeing monkeys all around. Make sure you are not carrying any food stuff like candys or icecreams in your hand. They snatch bags too. Since the caves are spread over acres of land and walking with kids can get difficult. So take an auto-rickshaw to see the place around. They will start with Rs.350-400 and you can bargain down upto Rs.150/180. Its worth it because they act as guides and the charge includes the waiting too. Not bad atall ! The caves are beautiful! Was it really the humans who hand carved those stones?! Unbelievable! The caves and huge statues in one single stone reminded us of Angkor Wat we recently visited. This kind of craftsmenship even with the help machines is not possible in todays world. It really must have been a magical era to be surrounded by thick jungles with no equipments the monks busy carving the stones day and night. Wonder where did they get that energy & motivation from and wonder what was their incentive, does faith insomething really drives a human to come up with such beautiful sculptures? I get overwhelmed seeing such creations ! :) Besides the main attraction of Kailash, ensure you go through the passage underneath a waterfall. Awesome! I think its in cave nr.22. I just wish and hope some of our fellow Indians appreciate the instructions and not climb on the structures to take snaps. These caves are a mix of Hindu/Buddhism and Jain religion. The main attraction is kailash temple which has a Shiva temple on the top. Make sure you walk around those surrounding galleries and watch the central structure of the temple. It is said that the temple is carved starting from the top and coming to the bottom, unlike the bottom to top logic. All in all an awesome place to visit. We have Ajanta on our cards for the next visit."
"Ellora Caves have been designated as a World Heritage Site, to be preserved as an artistic legacy that will continue to inspire and enrich the lives of generations to come. Ellora is an archaeological site, 29 km North-West of the city of Aurangabad in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is also known for its monumental caves. Ellora is a World Heritage Site represents the epitome of Indian rock-cut architecture. The 34 ""caves"" are actually structures excavated out of the vertical face of the Charanandri hills. Buddhist, Hindu and Jain rock-cut temples and viharas and mathas were built between the 5th century and 10th century. It is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India."
"The Center of attraction is the Kailash temple, the rest 33 caves are not concentrated at one location. So be prepared for a lot of walking. It is amazing to know that the Kailash temple was build or carved out top down, amazing architecture and talent."
"Good visit. Guides are good. Without guide, its not much helpful. Kailash Caves are the best and would recommend one to spend more time at important caves and give more time to Kailash Cave. You can avoid unimportant things and spend more time at Ellora instead of covering more points"
"The Ellora caves are just 30 odd km outside Aurangabad. Most visitors tend to combine these caves with a trip to the Daulatabad fort, Grihneshwar temple and Aurangabad city sights. This is a big mistake especially for those who love exploring ancient heritage sites. The Ellora caves are worthy of a day trip on their own. We had just a day left and we thought we could fit in the fort as well but we took over six hours at the caves so have left Daulatabad for another trip. The caves are open everyday except Tuesday, from sunrise to sunset, and it makes a lot of sense to start as early as possible - to beat both the heat and the crowds. We had hired a taxi from Aurangabad for the duration of our stay. We went in the monsoons and the vast site was lush green with several really big waterfalls adding to the ambience. In the summer it would get unbearably hot from 10am onward. The caves are grouped into three areas with separate parking. Auto rickshaws are available to transport visitors from site to site if you do not have your own arrangements. In pleasant weather, nature lovers would enjoy doing this visit on foot especially in the monsoons when waterfalls, lush greenery and wildflowers adorn the canvas. There is enough historical information on the net so I will not go into all that here. We had the time so we saw all the caves. It did get a tad exhausting towards the end when we felt somewhat 'caved' out. Anyone with a serious interest in architecture, stone carving and ancient history ought to spend at least two days if not more here. Cave 10 - The Visvakarma Cave, Cave 16 - The Great Kailash, Cave 21 The Ramesvara and Cave 32 - 34 The Indrasabha should be on the must see list for those who do not have much time or interest. Needless to say this is a photographers paradise. With the dimly lit caves, it does help to bring something better than just a phone camera. Unlike at Ajanta, I did not see any signs here prohibiting the use of tripods. We started from the magnificent Indrasabha in the Jaina group of caves at one end of the sprawling campus. After this, our driver drove us to Cave 29 where a mammoth waterfall just outside the cave presented a splendid sight. From here, we drove to the last site where the most famous Kailash cave is located amidst the Brahmanical and Buddhist group of caves. It was fairly easy to climb the rock face atop the Kailasha caves to get better views of that spectacular complex. What stood out for us at Ellora were the colossal size of some of the carvings. We marvelled at how the artisans might have done their work in those ancient times with primitive tools. A group of finely carved skeletal figures also posed some as yet unanswered questions. Tips: Thick soled walking shoes or sandals make for a comfortable visit with all the walking involved. Children might tire easily. And lastly, do carry drinking water and some snacks if you plan to spend hours there! These are available at the parking areas where you will also find several groups of gentle golden langurs helping themselves to food from the dustbins. The babies were very cute. I have been to Ellora before but the previous visit was some 35 years ago and I had all but forgotten how magnificent these caves are. Truly worthy of being a World Heritage Site."
"This is a must visit if you are in Aurangabad and is just a 45 mins drive away. Once there, you either can hire a guide to explain the rich history or alternately buy the Ellora & Ajanta handbook which is a self-help guide. The entry point starts from Cave. No 16 which is the Kailasha Temple and is biggest and the main attraction. Other main attractions include Cave No. 10 which is a chaitya hall with a Buddha sculpture set on a stupa. Caves 30-34 are the Jain Caves. You can't help but feel overawed at the sight of some of the sculptures...at the sheer detailing in an era when none of today's technology was available. Do note that a lot of the caves are either ruined or were incomplete, so do refer the handbook as this provides relevant information on the caves to visit."
This should be on the must-visit list of all history lovers. It is an excellent example of avant-garde engineering and art which is reasonable preserved over centuries. Kailasa temple is simply awesome.
"Good place, but needs a lot of time. Be prepared to walk a lot. One needs to take the bus ride after parking your car. To approach the bus stand you will need to walk through a small market which apart from artefacts also has refreshment shops. One need not see all the caves, security personnel will guide the cave numbers to be visited."
"We took taxi from shirdi to Ellora Caves. The trip to an ancient place of Indian history and 30 KM away from Aurangabad was memorable. The entry ticket including your vehicle, but the local auto-rickshaw wala compelled you to park your vehicle in parking area near the gate. Don't listen and take your vehicle close to all the places. If you fortunate to engage a good guide that will help you not only to explore the caves but also to save the time and energy. However it is difficult to see all the places in one day. To avoid hungry carry good amount of water, food pkts etc., There is no doubt a place to remain in your heart for years to come"
The caves are well maintained and a visit to the caves takes you back in time to regale on the history of this place. A Visit to Ajanta and Ellora caves is a must when you visit Aurangabad. A good and a knowledgeable guide makes a world of difference in enjoying the architecture and history of the caves..
"All the travel guides say Ellora is one of the must-see sights in India. They aren't exaggerating. I booked a tour with Ashok Travels in Aurangabad (the tour also took in Bibi Ka Maqbara, Daulatabad Fort and a few other places) so with such a packed schedule we could only spend a few hours here. Make this an all-day visit if you have time. Each of the caves are fascinating, most are stunning, but one really steals the show. Cave 16, the Kailasha Temple, is one of the most mind-blowing things I've ever seen. Don't even think about visiting Maharastra without seeing this. I completely drained my camera battery taking pictures to show people back home how amazing this was; they wouldn't have believed it without the pictures. The restaurant on-site is pretty good, albeit a little overpriced. If you only have one day free in Aurangabad and you're torn between Ellora and Ajanta, this should definitely be your first choice."
"In 2 hours i could only see 6 caves properly, it is too big and it needs almost one day to see everything properly with no hurries to absorv everything you will pay 250 ruppes for being a foreigner it is an amazing place, a must see definitely... the con points are, bathrooms are not so available as that and the vendor's that are really annoying that sometimes you almost want to punch them"

"One can barely take his eyes off from these huge sculptures in Ellora caves. There are around 34 caves spread across Buddhism, Jainism & Hinduism. Of all, two of the sculptures astonished me, the Buddhist ""Carpenter's"" cave (Cave 10) and The Hindu cave, Shiva-Parvati seated on mount Kailash, while Ravana tries to lift it (cave 29). Looking at those gigantic caves you will keep wondering how they were carved, simply superb! Words fall short to explain the experience of being inside these caves under these huge sculptures. A must visit place for those who like to explore Indian Art."
"Really excellent and special place to visit - BUT when you visit, take care to do it in a right time - not in a weekend mid-day, like we did, because at that time, place is full of people. Indian people have to pay only 5 rupees tickets, and foreigners 100 rupees... this means, there's a lot of Indians without real interest for this place, just running around with mobile phone cameras and posing with the sculptures - and staring at you or asking your name or country if you look like a foreigner. Area's canteen offers basic Indian food, but the quality is not so good (very salty). Same place will keep your lockages over your visiting time in caves, which is a good deal (20 rs one bag)."
"Very interesting, close to Aurangabad, so no problem to reach. Cave temples are similar to others (like Ajanta or Elephanta Island near Mumbai), but the biggest one with the temple is really must to see!"
This is a treasure trove of sculptures and rock carvings. The distance from Aurangabad is only about an hour maximum by car. As you approach the gates guides can be hired at this point. There are some touts that will approach you selling trinkets and post cards. I did not see a variety of places to buy water or eat at the entrance. I suggest you pack appropriately your food and drink. i could be mistaken as I was busy paying entrance fees and talking to a guide. Possibly someone else could confirm or deny eateries around the entrance. Once inside there is a sloping upward walk through well maintained grounds to the temples/caves. Being well prepared ahead of the visit and reading forward can eliminate the need for a guide. Flashes are usable inside the caves. I think you will find that Ajanta has more stunning interiors and Ellora has more appealing exteriors. You do not need to take off you shoes in most of Ellora. The terrain is flat except for the walk above the large monolith. Take at least one litre of water per person. Sunscreen and bug repellant is necessary. There are wide open areas of grass and some trees to have a picnic under. Where I felt Ajanta was a full day event I think Ellora can be finished and feel completely satiated in a 1/2 day. However Ajanta and Ellora should not be attempted in one day. The distance between the two sites is too large.
One should visit atleast once in life time to see the breathless sculptures. It requires whole day to see the various caves & painting. Definitely advise to take tour guide.
"Old is gold. Just enjoyed the carvings and the story behind each of them. I wish I could have spent a full one day in Ellora to complete all the caves (33 in total?). I could have completed upto 16 within 2 hours or so. Beware of people selling Rs.20 items (Ganpati/radhaKrishna dolls etc) for Rs. 280. You can bargain...but that are all waste of time. Best way is: Simply discourage them...do not drag conversation with sellers, just say, you are not interested."
"I reached Aurangabad around 11 am IST. After having lunch I and my family left for Ellora. Started exploring Ellora caves from 2pm onwards till evening 6pm. Govt guides cost around rs 750 for 90 min max. We opted for rickshaw guide for Rs 200 instead, as we had basic information on the caves. Rickshaw helped us cut short the walking around as we could spend quality time at the caves and explained to us the significance of the caves. Ellora caves are interesting because of three religion caves are located adjacent to each other. Further carry camera preferably digital, a torch, Night Vision equipment and camcorder (optional). Note that only few caves are important. Hence you need to spend more time on this caves. Note: You can cut short walking by having your vehical like car move from once location to another location."
"In most parts of the World, if there was an attraction like this, it would be a hot tourist destination, provided wonderful infrastructure, and marketed aggressively. It is a pity that despite having an amazing wonder like Ellora, the infrastructure is pathetic. However, let me begin with the good part. The Ellora caves are about 30 kms from Aurangabad, and so easy to reach. The road is also in pretty decent shape. There are 34 caves, divided in 3 parts : buddhist, hindu and jain caves. We visited the 2 prominent buddhist caves (incl the must see cave number 10), and the 7-8 hindu caves (incl the must visit Kailasa temple). The Kailasa temple is a masterpiece in stone. It is amazing how such carving has been done hundreds of years back. The buddhist caves and the ravana cave are also excellent. However, the issues are plentiful : No guide at the caves means it is impossible to find out what the carvings signify. The washrooms are broken and dirty. You cant even enter them. The parking at the jain caves is inadequate and we had to turn back as there was no space to get close to the parking. The sculptures are not protected and are getting vandalised. The Archaelogical Society of India (ASI) seems to be sleeping. This has potential to be like any wonder of the World, along with the Ajanta caves, if only someone would start treating them as a national treasure!!!! A few tips: wear good walking shoes, carry water with you, and ensure your bladder and stomach are empty!!!"
Ellora caves are really beautiful to see. Take some time and enjoy every corner of these caves. Probably take your fish eye lens with you to take the best pictures.
Its a wonder in stone. Must watch this top to bottom stone art. Its really surprising that how they carved this mammoth black stone with simple insturments
"Many cave idols were defaced by Mughal tyrant Aurangzeb. But, the architecture of the caves are great, considering how old they are and they were carved out of pure rock. The stench of bat-droppings is appalling considering that this is World Heritage site. It takes nearly 4 hours to see everything. Do not take a rickshaw, if you have your own vehicle. Take a guide with you! Take plenty of water as well."
"Ellora caves seem to be suitable for visit all through the year. The board boasts of 34 caves in Ellora, but a few of them are just shelters and there is not much to see. The rest are of course, architectural marvels in themselves. These caves are numbered serially, and are identified with their number and sometimes, names also. For eg, Cave 16 is also called Kailash. Some of them are also plastered and painted with vibrant colours (which of course, now may not be visible at all). eg., cave 32. These are spread around in a vast area (enclosed by fencing). You can either drive upto each cave, park your vehicle and visit and proceed OR, you can choose to walk the entire path. If you want to see all the caves, you are going to need atleast two full days. most packages like aurangabad darshan will allow you only 3 hrs or so to visit this place. It would be a good idea to hire a guide, or if that is expensive for you, just pay the guard 10/- and he will explain to you the significance of the cave, its sculptures / paintings. Especially cave 16 (right at the entrance to the facility) is a monolith, and structured by drilling from top to bottom. It is almost impossible to even imagine how such a thing could have been done in those times. Hats off to those sculptors. However, many caves may look similar (almost as if a competition was held and a winner chosen). The initial caves depict Buddhism, then Hinduism, and at the end, Jainism. Entry fee is very low, Rs.10/- for the entire site and no separate fee for camera. Definitely a place you should visit (and click lot of pics)."
"We are very much amazed the caves of ellora. its very nice caves with unbeliaviable sculptures. facilities are very good so you can drive your self to the cars. The most beautiful monument is the ""shiva temple"" The jyotirling temple which is ahead of the caves. one must see it. also please avoid with guides they dont know anything its a waste of money. over all it is nice place to visit."
Must see in once but make sure you visit before 4 Pm so you have ample time to see all caves. Also carry water as you will be walking lot. Do not litter the place. Best time to visit during rainy or winter season. Be watchful during rainy as it may get slippery.
A wonder of the world. varied temples and sculptures from 3 traditions. Extremely impressive and beautiful
"Ellora caves are astonishingly carved into hillside rock in the middle of nowhere. The caves at Ellora are a mixture of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain.The most incredible thing about these caves is that they were crafted by hand, with only a hammer and chisel. The Ellora caves are renowned for their extraordinary architecture. You can get an excellent view and perspective of inside the Kailasa temple by climbing up the hill around it. The best time to visit is from November to March when it's cooler and dry."
"The Ellora Caves are definitely worth working into your itinerary and will likely take most of the day to see. They are phenomenal. Guides were highly recommended, so we decided to shell out 750 Rs for a government guide. Others may have different experiences with other guides, but I must recommend against one named Siddarth. He did not give us much additional information from what we could read on the helpful plaques in front of the caves. He acted irritated when asked questions and often did not answer them. He refused to accompany us into the caves so we could ask more questions as we looked around. He tried to rush us and when we confronted him about this he stated we were ""killing his time"" and cited a bathroom break and questions as our offenses against him. We tired of his rushing and attitude and politely asked if we could pay him for the portion of the information and have him leave us. He yelled in Hindi for a long time and accused us of trying to cheat him and being beggars. We have had and found great value in many guides for many places in India, but this experience was terrible to a nearly comical extent. Please be warned against hiring this guide in particular. Perhaps getting a guidebook or reading the plaques is a safer bet."
"This is about 25 KM from Aurangabad. We hired a taxi to visit different places near by. There are 34 caves which are divided religion wise. Hindu caves, Jain caves and Buddhist caves. This is basically on the basis of the statues carved out. Hindu caves and Buddhist caves are nearby whereas Jain caves are slightly away, about 1 KM apart. Taxi dropped us in front of the cave no. 16 which is a Hindu cave and is the biggest of all caves in terms of carvings. Frankly it is an open cave. Jain caves are quite difficult to visit due to odor of urine inside. However, there is a beautiful fall a midst the caves. Buddhist caves are beautiful and clean. One should have plenty of water and food because it takes many hours to visit the caves. If a person wants to see all the caves then he/she will need more than a day."
ellora caves are good to see the caves are curved in olden times and it is difficult to understand the carving by the human beings of that ancient times. this is 20 miles from aurangabad city and the road is god enough.
"This World Heritage site is stunning. We arrived at lunch time having visited Daulatabad Fort in the morning. We ate at the MTDC restaurant in the grounds which served food fine for lunch, not sure I'd want to eat dinner there though. The caves were excellent but not as good as Ajanta which I adored. It seems that most only come here to see the Kailash Temple and it's understandable why: it's simply stunning."
nice caves curved from top to bottom in a mountain yous hould definetly visit this place a worth seing place. just 32 kms from aurangabad city and roads are good and safe good rerstaurants for meals full parking place good natural beaty aroun the caves
I found the sight more dramatic than Ajanta. Since Ajanta is the larger of the two sights I fear that some may skip Ellora to save time. I would do just the opposite: if only one sight is feasible time wise or interest wise--visit Ellora!
"The place is amazingly beautiful and clean too.You are simply amazed to see the kind work done in the caves.It took almost 400 years to carve the sculpture and caves and some of these sculptures still look very fresh and good although most of them have detoriated over a period of time.It is a place worth seeing ,knowing culture and history and the work there. There are more than 20 caves worth seeing spread over a kilometer.Seeing it now makes you feel how can this be done.They are still standing strong"
"The main cave was, I think, one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. Not sure I can put it into words ... truly amazing. You'll need at least 3 hours to do it justice and, if you can, avoid the hottest part of the day - quite exhausting."
I along with my family members visited on 15th may 2011 to Ellora caves .this season is very hot and not recommanded to out of country visiters as the temperature is generally 40 to 42 degree centigrade. All the caves are really good but you should not miss KAILASH cave and should spend as much time as possible. You must carry plenty of water bottles along with you if you are visiting in summer season as you feel very thrusty. Best time is you should start seeing at 8.30 to 9 am in morning till 5.30 PM in evening.
"Ellora- Just read in history books. Never thought I too can see the history- The history of Indian Sculptures. This sculptures demonstrates our Indian culture and religion. You have to take strain to see all the caves- But a worth watch. Kids may not enjoy all caves; most caves have sculptures’ of similarity. No lighting , Better carry a torch if possible"
This is an excellent place to visit. One should visit ellora caves when visiting India - Aurangabad. The only care to be taken is of transportation. If you hire a car from Aurangabad you can cover 2 destinations in a single day - Ajanta caves & ellora caves. Besided caves you can also have fresh fruits & other ayurvedic products sold by local people.
"Spectacular series of Budhist, Hindu and Jain rock cut and cave temples.from 4th to 11th century Unbelievable and unspoilt (largely) sculptures. The prettiest is undoubtedly the Kailashnath Temple and it is mind boggling to wonder how a complete Hill was cut vertically to create this marvel. A must see ina lifetime. Easier access than to Ajanta cave paintings from Aurangabad. Went in hot weather - carry water - very little available and best to move around the area in a hired vehicle, otherwise can be tedious to walk around. Should be even nicer in Monsoon. An added attraction is the adjacent Jyotirlinga at Grushneswara and the Daulatabad fort of the mad monarch Muhammed bin Tughlaq. If you have missed the Taj, you can also spot its vastly inferior copy, the Bibi ka Maqbara, made of spartan concrete and white paint rather than marble!"
A stunning UNESCO World Heritage Site with a unique rock-cut cave complex! Absolutely worth visiting!
A jaw dropping historical site that should not be missed if you are in the area. Relatively easy to visit and would recommend taking a guide for the visit.
Amazing architecture especially the Kailasa temple in Cave 16. Plan to spend some time at this place among other caves here.
"Must visit for any Indian, rich history, do take a guide to know everything about the place, it takes around 2 - 2.5 hours to cover the caves, etc. Small entry fee."
"Ellora Caves are an absolute must-visit on your trip to Aurangabad. Heck, it's worth making a trip to Aurangabad for Ellora (and Ajanta) caves - and for the people. As pointed out by our super -knowledgeable guide, these caves are not really caves which are naturally occurring, but distinct and deliberate creations across centuries. The first set of caves at Ellora are Buddhist in origin, covering but Hinayana and Mahayana ideologies. Then come the Hindu ones, the crown jewel of which is Cave #16 aka Kailasa Temple. And a short bus ride away are the 4 Jain caves. Our guide, Ali, walked us through all the main sections, not just explaining the architecture, design and history behind the caves, but also engaging with us to clarify our many questions and thoughts. He was truly one of a kind and I recommend getting a guide if you are visiting Ellora for the first time - if you are lucky, you'll bump into Ali :) Ellora caves and specifically Kailasa Temple, is deserving of finding it's place as one of the wonders of the world. It's beautiful and you should look to keep anywhere a minimum of 3-4 hours to fully explore the whole set of caves with a government-certified guide. During our trip to Aurangabad, we also covered Ajanta caves, Khuldabad, Daulatabad/Deogiri fort, amongst other places. Our constant companion through 3 full days of our trip was Hussain, who not only took us around in his car but also provided valuable information and introduced us to the right people, shop, restaurants and much more to ensure our trip is well rounded. Above all, he was tireless and extremely helpful in every which way possible. With Hussain, there was never a dull moment or one where we felt that we were not taken care of. A true gem of a person, who made our trip amazing beyond compare. The caves and other monuments around the city are quite a distance away, so even if you bring your own car, do consider having Hussain drive you around so you can enjoy the experience fully. The climb up Daulatabad/Deogiri fort or trekking about the caves tends to leave you tired and a taxi makes utmost sense. Hussain has years of experience with foreign and domestic visitors, so do reach out to him and let him give you the best that Aurangabad has to offer. He also does inter-city pick up and drops. MD Hussain. +91 9923616671 Mdhusin5494@gmail.com"
"Ellora caves is rightly classified as Unesco heritage site. The caves from 3 different religions Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism show a long history and legacy of India. The highlight of the caves is the Kailash Temple which is the world's largest temple carved out of a single mountain face. A must visit for anyone"
"Visited on a Sunday and it was really crowded Ensure that you get your tickets online so that you don’t have to wait outside Huge place so even with all the people around it looked relatively empty, except for the CAVE NO 17 which is in the middle and was unduly crowded The cab driver had told us that if we visit and see this cave it is enough as all other caves would have something in it which is there here. I suppose all cabbies suggest the same and hence the crowds here Keep around 1.5 to 2.0 hours for the cave and make sure that you have comfortable walking shoes so that you can enjoy the beauty of the place"
"Visit the imp caves only, but some are very far so last few you can skip. Lot of walking involved and occasional climbing stair is also required. But he experience is amazing and worth it."
Beautiful site if you want to understand with the licenced guide then contact ajantaguide@gmail.com or 9890024884
"The nearest bus stop is Ellora caves. Buses from Aurangabad leave for ellora caves say every 30-40 minutes from Central Bus stand, Aurangabad. The journey takes about 40-45 minutes and the Ellora caves bus stop is right in front of entrance of Ellora caves. The bus ticket costs Rs 40 per person. We get tourist taxis from Aurangabad for Rs 1200-1500 which will cover Gruhaneshwar temple, Ellora caves, daulatabad Fort, Bhadra maruthi temple, Aurangzeb Tomb and Biki ka maqbara in one day. There are few restaurants near entrance of Ellora caves,i will suggest to have food and buy water bottles before entering the caves. We booked the tickets to this cave via ASI website which saved us a few minutes of standing in queue to get tickets. The ticket costed Rs 35 for Indian citizens. These caves are closed on Tuesdays and opens at 6:00 Am on other days. I will suggest to reach this place as early as possible to avoid heat during later part of the day. We hired a guide who approached us at the entrance of caves who charged us Rs 800. The guide took us to all caves except the Jain caves.I will recommend to hire a guide for visiting these caves. The caves are majestic and will take about 3 hours to cover all the caves( Buddhists, Jain and Hindu caves). There involves a lot of walking and please come prepared for that.Just at the entrance of the Ellora caves we can see Kailasnatha temple. Hindu & Buddhist caves are towards right of kailashnath temple.For going to Jain caves there is a government bus which comes and halts at a place which is about 2-3 minute walk from entrance of cave. The frequency of this bus is say 30-40 minutes and costs Rs 20(up-down) and the drive is of 5 minutes. The bus stops near Jain caves and gives tourists 30 minutes to visit the Jain caves and to return back to the bus. One has to come back to the entrance of the cave in the same bus in which takes one goes to the caves. Toilet is clean in Ellora caves and is situated in left side after we enter the ellora caves. I could find only one toilet and will request authorities to build at least one more toilet near Buddhist/Hindu caves. I did not find any shops selling food inside Ellora caves so have food before entering these caves and also please stock up sufficient drinking water.Also observed these caves are wheel chair friendly. From entrance of Ellora caves we can get share autos(Not sure about how frequent we get share autos) to go to Khuladabad(To visit Aurangzeb tomb and Bhadra maruthi temple) at Rs 20 per person. A must visit place while in Aurangabad and please do not try to see both Ellora caves and Ajantha caves in one day as both are located at a distance of 100 Kms from each other.If you are planning to visit Gruhaneshwar temple also, then i will suggest you to first visit Gruhaneshwar temple and then visit Ellora caves."
It’s situated about 40 km from the airport It takes u about an hr to reach Ellora .... When u reach the main entrance u have to get tickets by scanning QR code and make payment online ... or u can que and get tickets the conventional way .... Bring ur self water bottle and wear proper shoes .... there are many caves inside but few are worth the visit ... best to get a guide a good one will explain u in detail and tell I how to move around and location for you to click photos ... my guide cost me rs500 It would take u about 2 hrs to cover main caves ....
Absolutely magnificent. Unbelievable how they built these monuments. So fascinating. An heritage site not to be missed.
Ellora is a must visit for any one. It's quite close to Aurangabad. To do justice to this historical monumement you need atleast 3 hours
Thanks to our guide Deepak we were introduced to the intricate religious divercity of India and came to understand just a tiny portion which enlightened the gobsmacking creation of these caves. An overwhelming experience
